A statement issued by Murray\u2019s office said he called a cemetery representative Wednesday regarding the monument, which was erected in 1926. The cemetery is privately owned.  Lake View Cemetery closed Wednesday afternoon after receiving threats related to the monument, said Craig Lohr of the Lake View Cemetery Association. Seattle news media recently reported on the existence of the monument.  The cemetery \u2014 best known as the final resting place for martial-arts star Bruce Lee and his son Brandon, as well as Seattle\u2019s founders \u2014 will likely reopen Thursday morning.  Murray\u2019s statement comes after a deadly weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Ku Klux Klan members and white nationalists protested over the removal of a statue depicting Confederate general Robert E. Lee.  The mayor\u2019s statement said:  \u201cWe must remove statues and flags that represent this country\u2019s abhorrent history of slavery and oppression based on the color of people\u2019s skin. It is the right thing to do. During this troubling time when neo-Nazis and white power groups are escalating their racist activity, Seattle needs to join with cities and towns across the country who are sending a strong message by taking these archaic symbols down.\u201d  The mayor\u2019s office couldn\u2019t be reached to clarify Murray\u2019s statement.  A petition on Change.org calling for the removal of the memorial had more than 3,200 supporters late Wednesday afternoon.  Also on Wednesday, a small group of protesters gathered around the Vladimir Lenin statue in Fremont to demand its removal. The statue, located on private property, has been for sale for years and has been vandalized with red paint on one of its hands.Caption:  The Confederate monument at Lake View Cemetery on Capitol Hill Steve Ringman / The Seattle TimesMemo:  Paige Cornwell: 206-464-2530 or pcornwell@seattletimes.com"}
