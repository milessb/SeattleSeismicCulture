The quake, centered about 12 miles north-northeast of Yakima, occurred about 2:25 p.m.    No injuries or damage had been reported, Allen said, though she noted that about 46 buildings had collapsed in the area since Tuesday - mostly flat-roofed fruit warehouses and other commercial sites unable to bear the weight of snow dumped by two recent winter storms. Yesterday, as rainfall began and temperatures rose, many area roads were awash.    The pattern of heavy snow followed by rain and rising temperatures moved from the west side of the state.    \"Well, now it's nailing us, and we're not real appreciative,\" Allen told a Seattle caller. \"We'd just as soon you kept it over there.", "edition": "Final"}
