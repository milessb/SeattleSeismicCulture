Most vulnerable are memory chip prices, which account for about 10 percent of the cost of the typical home computer. Japanese factories supplied about 50 percent of the memory chips sold last year.    With such a large market share, computer-memory brokers began raising prices in anticipation of shortages. In the past two days, prices on some products rose as much as 21 percent at the wholesale level.    \"We're definitely going to see an impact. At the very least the quake will delay shipments, and supplies of memory were already tight,\" said Rick Scherle, president of Kelly Micro Systems in Irvine, Calif.    Semiconductor manufacturers say it's too early to report specifics. Plants that weren't damaged could be affected, because Japan's transportation systems were devastated.    \"We've been told there was only slight damage at our facilities, but it's difficult to know what that means,\" said Annette Birkett, a spokeswoman for Toshiba America Electronic Components in Irvine, whose company makes a variety of computer parts, including memory chips.    Concern is heightened because demand for memory chips has increased with the popularity of software, such as Windows, that requires lots of memory to perform well. Today, a minimum of 8 megabytes of memory is recommended for home users", "edition": "Final"}
