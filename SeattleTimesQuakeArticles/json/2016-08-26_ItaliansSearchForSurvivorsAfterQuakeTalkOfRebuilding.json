A day after the deadly quake killed at least 250 people, a 4.3 magnitude aftershock sent up plumes of thick gray dust in the hard-hit town of Amatrice. The aftershock crumbled already cracked buildings, rattled residents and closed already clogged roads.  It was only one of the more than 470 temblors that have followed the quake that struck early Wednesday.  Firefighters and rescue crews using sniffer dogs worked in teams around the hard-hit areas in central Italy, pulling chunks of concrete, rock and metal from mounds of rubble where homes once stood. Rescuers refused to say when their work would shift from saving lives to recovering bodies, noting that one person was pulled alive from the rubble 72 hours after the 2009 quake in the nearby town of L\u2019Aquila.  \u201cWe will work relentlessly until the last person is found, and make sure no one is trapped,\u201d said Lorenzo Botti, a rescue-team spokesman.  Worst affected by the quake were the towns of Amatrice and Accumoli near Rieti, 60 miles northeast of Rome, and Pescara del Tronto, 15 miles farther east.  Many people were left homeless, their houses and apartments declared uninhabitable. Some survivors, escorted by firefighters, were allowed to go back inside homes briefly Thursday to get necessities for what will be an extended absence.  \u201cLast night we slept in the car. Tonight, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Nello Caffini as he carried his sister-in-law\u2019s belongings on his head after being allowed to go into her home in Pescara del Tronto.  Caffini has a house in nearby Ascoli, but said his sister-in-law was too terrified by the aftershocks to go inside it. \u201cWhen she is more tranquil, we will go to Ascoli,\u201d he said.  Charitable assistance began pouring into the earthquake zone in traffic-clogging droves Thursday. Church groups and farmers offering donated peaches, pumpkins and plums sent vans along the one-way road into Amatrice that was already packed with emergency vehicles and trucks carrying sniffer dogs.  Italy\u2019s civil-protection agency said the death toll had risen to 250 by Thursday afternoon, with more than 180 of the deaths in Amatrice. At least 365 people were hospitalized, and 215 people had been pulled from the rubble alive. A Spaniard and five Romanians were among the dead, according to their governments.  There was no clear estimate of how many people might still be missing, since the rustic area was packed with summer vacationers. The Romanian government alone said 11 of its citizens were missing.  Emergency services set up tent cities around the quake-devastated towns to accommodate the homeless, housing about 1,200 people overnight. In Amatrice, 50 elderly people and children spent the night inside a local sports facility.  \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for them,\u201d said civil-protection volunteer Tiziano De Carolis, who was helping to care for the homeless in Amatrice. \u201cThey have lost everything: the work of an entire life, like those who have a business, a shop, a pharmacy, a grocery store.\u201d  As the search effort continued, the soul-searching began.  Premier Renzi authorized a preliminary 50 million euros (more than $56 million) in emergency funding, and the government canceled taxes for residents, pro forma measures that are the start of what will be a long and costly rebuilding campaign. He announced a new initiative, \u201cItalian Homes,\u201d to answer years of criticism over shoddy construction across the country, which has the highest seismic hazard in Western Europe.  But he also said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to think Italy could build completely quake-proof buildings. \u201cIt\u2019s illusory to think you can control everything,\u201d he said at a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to imagine it could have been avoided simply using different building technology. We\u2019re talking about medieval-era towns.\u201d  Armando Zambrano, the head of Italy\u2019s National Council of Engineers, said the technology exists to reinforce old buildings and prevent such high death tolls when quakes strike every few years. While he estimated it would cost up to 93 billion euros ($105 billion) to reinforce all of the historic structures across the country, he said targeted efforts in the riskiest areas could be done for less.  \u201cWe are able to prevent all these deaths. The problem is actually doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cThese tragedies keep happening because we don\u2019t intervene. After each tragedy we say we will act but then the weeks go by and nothing happens.\u201d  Some experts estimate that 70 percent of Italy\u2019s buildings aren\u2019t built to anti-seismic standards, though not all are in high-risk areas.Caption:  People walk through a tent camp in Arquata Del Tronto, Italy, on Thursday, after a 6.2 magnitude earthquake a day earlier   killed at least 250 people.
