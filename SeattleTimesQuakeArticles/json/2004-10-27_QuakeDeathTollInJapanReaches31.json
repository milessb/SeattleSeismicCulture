A 6.0-magnitude earthquake today hit the area of northern Japan where a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck Saturday, buckling roads and causing landslides. The death toll rose to 31 as elderly victims died from the effects of the weekend quake. No injuries or damage were immediately reported from the aftershocks that rumbled across largely rural Niigata prefecture, 160 miles northwest of Tokyo, Another 5,000 residents entered public shelters amid fears the aftershocks would trigger more landslides, raising the total of evacuated people to more than 103,000. Thousands more camped out in tents and cars, too afraid to return home. Koizumi said he would \"take measures for necessary funds,\" but he didn't discuss specifics. The stress of living in shelters has pressured quake survivors, many of whom are elderly. A 91-year-old man died from post-traumatic shock at a hospital in Koide yesterday. An 81-year-old man from nearby Ojiya died from a stroke. Three others died from earthquake-induced problems.Caption:  mapThe Associated Press: Death toll from quakes rises (GS4OR3HL)", "edition": "Fourth"}
