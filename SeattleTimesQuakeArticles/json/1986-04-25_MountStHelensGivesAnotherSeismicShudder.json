(UPI) _ Mount St. Helens vibrated this morning with its fifth seismic burst in 24 hours.         The burst indicated another possible ash or gas emission, but thick clouds hid any possible plume from view, scientists said.         The latest ``seismic event'' occurred at 5:25 a.m., said Steven Brantley, spokesman for the U.S. Geological Survey. Similar small bursts were recorded shortly before 6 a.m., at 10 a.m., at 12:14 p.m. and at 8:27 p.m. yesterday.         The seismic signals were similar to those produced by other ``de-gassing'' events in the past two weeks, some of which produced ash plumes that rose several thousand feet above the volcano. There were no reports from National Weather Service radar or pilots in the area of any plumes from the latest events.         ``These ash plumes are caused by de-gassing activity of the volcano's lava dome and are not considered significant by geologists in terms of increased hazard to the public or as indicators of an imminent eruption,'' Brantley said.         Overall seismic readings beneath the mountain remained at normal or ``background'' levels, Brantley said.         The mountain began its rumblings April 13, breaking 10 months of quiet. That was the longest period of inactivity since the southwest Washington volcano broke more than a century of slumber with its deadly May 1980 blast, which blew the top off the mountain and killed more than 40 people.", "edition": "Zone"}
