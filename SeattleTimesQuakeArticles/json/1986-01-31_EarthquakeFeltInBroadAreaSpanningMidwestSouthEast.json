There were some reports of minor damage, but no injuries.         The U.S. Geological Service in Golden, Colo., said the tremor was moderate, measuring 5 on the Richter scale. A spokesman for the survey said the strength of the quake was sufficient to cause minor damage.         The quake's epicenter was about 30 miles northeast of Cleveland.         The quake was reported felt in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin, and Ontario, Canada. It started at 11:47 a.m. EST and lasted about 30 seconds.         ``It sent our whole city into panic,'' said a police dispatcher in Mentor, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, near the center of the quake.         ``I've never felt anything like it in the 18 years I've been here. The police department is in a three-story building, and it shook the whole thing,'' he said.         The dispatcher said one store owner reported the partial collapse of his ceiling but no injuries. He said other scattered, minor damage occurred, and a few people suffered cuts and bruises.         The quake shook Detroit and Buffalo, and in Columbus it was felt as three separate tremors. Officials in the Chicago area also reported feeling the tremor.         Police stations, newspapers and broadcast stations were flooded with calls.         Quakes are uncommon but not unknown in the region. The last one of note occurred in 1980.", "edition": "Third"}
