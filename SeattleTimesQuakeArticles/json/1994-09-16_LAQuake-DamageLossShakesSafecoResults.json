Safeco's reinsurance covers 90 percent of its losses between $50 million and $200 million. After reinsurance, Safeco expects a $27.5 million increase in its estimated losses for the third quarter.    Company officials attributed the increase to the unusual vertical force of the quake; damage was more extensive than initially predicted.", "edition": "Final"}
