Residents from Tacoma, Puyallup, Bremerton, Seattle and Redmond reported feeling the quake, which hit at 10:22 p.m., according to the Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network at the University of Washington.    No damage or injuries were reported.    The network estimated the quake at a magnitude 3. A magnitude 3 is generally the smallest quake that can be felt by people.    The quake was about 14.5 miles below the earth's surface, according to the seismograph network at the UW's geophysics program.    Bill Steele, UW seismology lab coordinator, said the quake was centered in the area of Maury Island, which was the site of a magnitude 5 quake in January 1995.    This quake was probably widely felt because of its depth, he said.    \"Deeper quakes shake less violently at the surface but are felt over a wide area,\" he said.    He said aftershocks were not expected.    Separately, a magnitude 5.7 quake occurred at 4:45 a.m. today under the Pacific Ocean off Vancouver Island, about 115 miles southwest of Port Hardy, B.C.    The U.S. Geological Survey center in Golden, Colo., said it was unrelated to the Puget Sound quake.    The biggest earthquakes in Washington in the past 50 years were one near Olympia that registered 7.1 in 1949 and one measuring 6.5 near Renton in 1965.", "edition": "Final"}
