At least 134 people were killed.   Government spokesman Hotman Apik said 500 people were seriously injured. The earthquake struck just after midnight. It had an initial Richter scale reading of 6.5, according to officials in Jakarta. The U.S. Geological Survey in Washington put its strength at 7.2.     Several hours later, another earthquake hit the northern Chinese province of Qinghai, the Hong Kong Royal Observatory reported.     The Chinese quake's strength was estimated at 5.6 on the Richter scale, and the epicenter was 110 miles west of the city of Xining. It was timed at 5:14 a.m. No word was available on damage.    The province of Lampung, on southeastern Sumatra about 125 miles northwest of Jakarta, was believed to have been hardest hit by the Indonesian quake. Quake damage and heavy rains churned up roads and cut phone and power lines. A blackout plunged western Lampung into darkness soon after the tremor hit.", "edition": "Final"}
