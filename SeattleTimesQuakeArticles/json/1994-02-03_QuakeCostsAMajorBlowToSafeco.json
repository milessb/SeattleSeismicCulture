Safeco said today that its losses in the Jan. 17 earthquake are expected to exceed $50 million. The worst loss for Safeco was the 1991 Oakland, Calif., fires, where damage totaled $125 million. Until this quake, No. 2 on the list was last year's Inauguration Day storm in the Northwest, which cost Safeco $27 million.    Safeco stock was down 37.5 cents, to $58.125, in late trading.    Firm numbers for the California quake are not yet available, and the effect the losses will have on first-quarter profits is unknown. Safeco decided to report what it knew today, since reinsurance kicks in above $50 million. Another insurer engaged by Safeco will pay 90 percent of all claims between $50 million and $200 million. Safeco is responsible for losses of less than $50 million.     Because of the widespread damage to communications and transportation systems, \"it will be some time before a reasonable estimate of the company's losses can be made,\" said Boh Dickey, executive vice president and chief financial officer.     The company has received about 5,500 claims so far.     Safeco's own leased branch office in Van Nuys, Calif., where 160 employees worked, was severely damaged.  Safeco has leased other space, to which it expects to move next week. Safeco has 376 adjusters on the scene.     Meanwhile, Safeco said winter weather in the Midwest and East is expected to cost Safeco about $5 million.", "edition": "Final"}
