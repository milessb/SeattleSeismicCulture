Provincial officials said the quake measured 5.7 on the Richter scale. The U.S. Geological Survey said it was centered in the Pacific Ocean, 190 miles south of Prince Rupert.    There were no reports of damage or injuries. The quake was too weak to generate a tsunami - a large ocean wave - but was felt as far away as Bella Bella on the B.C. mainland.    The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage, and 6 can be severe.", "edition": "Final"}
