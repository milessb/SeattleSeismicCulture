In February, there were 5,245 sales of homes and condos--a 5.8 percent increase from a year ago in the six-county area of King, Snohomish, Pierce, Kitsap, Skagit and Grays Harbor counties, according to the Northwest Multiple Listing Service. Sales actually dropped in King County by 5.9 percent, but rose 31 percent in Kitsap County and 24 percent in Snohomish County. The median price for homes and condos in King County was $230,000, up from $225,000 the same month a year ago. In Snohomish County, the median price was $201,000, up from $181,575 the same month a year ago. Agents say warm weather usually helps sales, but brokers mainly attributed the sales gain to low interest rates. They don't anticipate earthquake re-inspections to slow down the market this month. \"We've only had a couple of buyers ask for re-inspections of homes they bought,\" said Mike Skahen, broker at Lake &amp; Co. in Seattle. Some of the sales increase can be chalked up to greater inventory of homes on the market. In February, there were 19,927 homes for sale in the six-county area, up 11 percent from 17,896 the same month a year ago.
