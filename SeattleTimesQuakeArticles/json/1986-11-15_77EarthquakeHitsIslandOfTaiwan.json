The National Police Administration said the earthquake knocked down a three-story building in suburban Taipei. Seven bodies were pulled from the ruins and 36 people were taken to 13 hospitals, police said.        Officials said between 30 and 50 people still were trapped in the building, which had apartments upstairs and grocery stores on the ground floor. Workers were preparing to open the stores when the earthquake struck.        In a harbor on the east coast, a fisherman was killed when his boat capsized during the earthquake, police said.        The quake, which lasted about 2 minutes, cracked homes and caused tall buildings to sway in northern Taiwan.        The USGS said the earthquake was the most powerful to hit Taiwan since a temblor with a magnitude of 8.3 struck June 5, 1920. The last earthquake that caused damages and casualties in Taiwan was on May 20, 1986. It measured 6.4 on the Richter scale.        Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau described the quake as ``strong'' and located the epicenter 6.4 miles underwater about 26 miles off the northeast coast.        The bureau said the earthquake lasted about 2 minutes and an aftershock hit at 7:04 a.m. The quake caused less damage than originally feared because the epicenter was offshore, the bureau said.        The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu issued a regional tsunami watch for parts of the western Pacific but canceled it 30 minutes later after determining the quake did not generate a tidal wave.", "edition": "Second"}
