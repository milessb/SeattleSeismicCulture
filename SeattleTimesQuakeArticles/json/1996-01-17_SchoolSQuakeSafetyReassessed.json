The findings mean the district will have to spend $1.5 million less than expected to fix the school, which was closed last fall after district officials discovered that the 34-year-old masonry school was built largely without steel reinforcement.     According to an engineering consultant who specializes in earthquake safety, many of the walls can resist earthquakes as well as the walls of a newly constructed building. The study found 78 of the 415 walls in the Clyde Hill school need strengthening to meet today's seismic-safety codes.     The district is asking voters to approve a $10.9 million capital-projects levy Feb. 6 to pay for structural improvements to Chinook and several other schools that are seismically unsafe.      District spokeswoman Ann Oxrieder said it's too late to change the wording on the ballot, so if the project does come in at $1.5 million under budget, the district won't collect the additional money from taxpayers.", "edition": "Final"}
