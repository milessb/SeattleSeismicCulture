Preliminary estimates put the quake at 3.5 on the Richter scale of ground motion. An earthquake that size can cause slight damage in a local area.     Bill Langford, Grays Harbor County emergency-management director, said no injuries were reported but residents told of \"chairs sliding across the floor, knickknacks falling off television sets and a small power outage in South Aberdeen.\"     The temblor at 8:42 a.m. was centered just north of Montesano, about 33 miles west of Olympia, and occurred about 20 miles beneath the surface, said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University of Washington's geophysics center. It was felt in Olympia and in Aberdeen on the coast, she said.     The Richter scale is the ground motion recorded on seismographs. An increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.     The 1964 Alaska quake that killed 131 people measured 8.4 on the Richter scale, while the San Francisco quake of 1906 was estimated at 8.3.", "edition": "Final"}
