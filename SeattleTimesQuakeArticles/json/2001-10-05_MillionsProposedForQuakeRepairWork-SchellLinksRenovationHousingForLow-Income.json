Schell made the announcement at Chinatown's Hip Sing Building, built in 1910. The building used to be a rooming house, but its upper floors have been closed for 40 years because of the high costs of bringing the structure up to fire codes. Like many other buildings in the area, it was damaged in the February earthquake. The loan fund is intended to help building owners repair earthquake damage and put back in service deteriorating vacant spaces within the city. The Washington State Housing Finance Commission will issue tax-exempt bonds to the city's Office of Housing, which will pass the savings on to private-building owners in the form of below-market-rate loans. In return, the building owners must set aside 40 percent of the units for people who make only 60 percent of the median income. The plan goes before the City Council on Oct. 24.Caption:  photoPaul Schell", "edition": "Fourth"}
