Some residents called radio and TV stations to say they were awakened about 1:15 a.m. and 2:30 a.m. by a slight shaking they thought was a quake.    University of Washington seismology spokesman Bill Steele says what they actually felt was the last of three nights of testing.    Scientists have been setting off underground blasts from the Cascades to Hood Canal to map what's beneath the area.  The sound waves bounce back to 1,000 seismometers.     Steele said the information will help scientists understand how the region would react to a quake. The 25-pound explosive charges were set off 100 feet deep.", "edition": "Final"}
