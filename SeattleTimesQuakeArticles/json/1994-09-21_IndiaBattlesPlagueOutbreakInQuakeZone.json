Indian officials have said the plague is of the bubonic type, which spreads from fleas that live on rats, and not the more deadly pneumonic variety that can spread through human contact.     The Health Ministry said no one had died from the disease, which was recently discovered in the western state of Maharashtra, hit a year ago by India's worst earthquake in a half-century.     A team of government health experts who visited the region Monday said 64 people had been struck by the disease, which the government believed was eradicated years ago.     Patients in all cases have responded positively to treatment, the government said in a statement released after an emergency meeting of senior health officials.     State authorities have sprayed the chemicals DDT and BHC in suspected plague-hit areas to kill the fleas that spread the disease after biting infected rats.     Following the earthquake, rats multiplied in houses converted into granaries after quake survivors shifted to safer shelters.     Insecticides should be sprayed every six to 12 weeks, the ministry said.     Before the current outbreak, India's last plague case was reported in 1966. Nearly 12 million people died in a plague epidemic at the beginning of the century.", "edition": "Final"}
