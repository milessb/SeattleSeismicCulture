A group of Giants, including Will Clark, Robby Thompson, Matt Williams and Don Robinson, yesterday went to the Moscone Center, bringing souvenirs and handshakes to those rendered homeless or without food by Tuesday's major earthquake.        ``Hey, win the baseball game, Will Clark,'' one man shouted as the Giants left.        The visit centered on the ``teddy bear room'' set aside for children, families, the handicapped and the elderly.        ``I think it's great,'' said Giant Manager Roger Craig. ``More so than gifts. It makes everybody feel better. Not just them but us.''        A spokeswoman for the Athletics said the A's planned no similar tour, though pitcher Dave Stewart has said he toured the area on his own.", "edition": "Final"}
