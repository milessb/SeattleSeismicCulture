The tremor, which registered about 5.4 on the Richter scale, struck at 11:56 p.m. Alaska Standard Time  yesterday and was centered about 80 miles west of Anchorage, said Bill Zitek of the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer.        The quake was felt throughout Anchorage and ``very strongly in Palmer,'' where ``it woke everybody up,'' he said.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion in which every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.        An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause considerable damage, and 6 can be severe.        The quake which killed 131 people in Alaska in 1964 registered 8.4 Richter, and the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 was estimated at 8.3.", "edition": "Second"}
