It was a week to the day after the \"very strong\" 7.0 quake that did such damage in Haiti. Tuesday's new quake was six miles beneath the sea, 32 miles east-southeast of the Cayman capital of George Town. It caused no injuries. It was 600 miles west of Port-au-Prince and 430 miles south of Miami. The latest quake, like last week's, was on the boundary between the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates. But the Cayman quake was not on the Enriquillo Fault Line that caused Haiti's quake, said Dr. Tim Dixon, a geophysicist at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science in Miami.", "edition": "Fourth"}
