The quake, which struck Sunday in Yunnan province, toppled thousands of homes, according to China\u2019s Xinhua news agency. Rescuers Monday were still trying to reach remote towns near the epicenter \u2014 in Longtoushan township, 277 miles northeast of Yunnan\u2019s capital, Kunming \u2014 meaning that the death toll could rise significantly.  Xinhua reported that the vast majority of the deaths \u2014 357 \u2014 occurred in Zhaotong, and 10 more in Quijing. Both are in Ludian County, which has a population of about 429,000 people.  Ma Liya, a resident of Zhaotong, told Xinhua that her neighborhood looked like a battlefield after bombardment. She said that her neighbor\u2019s two-story house had toppled, even though it was relatively new, and that the quake was far worse than one that struck the area in 2012 and killed 81 people.  \u201cThe aftermath is much, much worse than what happened after the quake two years ago,\u201d Ma was quoted as saying. \u201cI have never felt such strong tremors before. What I can see are all ruins.\u201d  There were conflicting accounts on the quake\u2019s strength. The U.S. Geological Survey reported it reached a magnitude of 6.1, striking at 4:30 p.m. at a depth of six miles. Xinhua described it as a magnitude 6.5 temblor.  Earthquakes are a sensitive topic for China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, ever since roughly 90,000 people either died or disappeared in the 2009 earthquake in Sichuan province. In the days after that disaster, the government attempted to suppress reports that lax building standards and inspections had contributed to the toll, including the deaths of hundreds of children in collapsed school buildings.  In a statement late Sunday, China\u2019s President Xi Jinping ordered authorities \u201cto give top priority to saving people\u2019s lives, minimize casualties and guarantee a proper settlement for quake victims,\u201d Xinhua reported.  Premier Li Keqiang also issued a statement ordering local authorities to set up relief camps and emergency clinics for thousands of displaced families. The government was also working to restore electricity and telecommunications. \u201cSocial order in the quake zone should also be maintained,\u201d Xinhua reported Li as saying.  Yunnan province, mountainous and on the border with Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, has a history of deadly earthquakes. A magnitude 7.7 quake killed 15,000 people there in 1980, and a magnitude 7.1 quake killed 1,400 more in 1974.Caption:  Rescuers carry injured people after an earthquake struck Sunday in Yunnan province of China and toppled thousands of homes.
