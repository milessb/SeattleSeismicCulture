No serious damage or injuries were reported from the tremor, described as an aftershock of a severe 1992 quake.    The quake at 7:24 a.m. had a magnitude of 5.4 and was centered 12 miles east-northeast of the desert town of Barstow, 100 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, said seismologist Lucy Jones at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.    It created a 2.5-inch-long crack on a bridge over Interstate 40 in Barstow.    However, the span was considered safe and remained open to traffic, California Highway Patrol Officer Willie Hailey said.    Several dozen liquor bottles and other objects fell from shelves at a drugstore in downtown Los Angeles.    \"It was rumbling. You heard it, that was what was really scary,\" said Maryadonna Hawk in Victorville.    It was one of more than 60,000 aftershocks to the magnitude-7.3 Landers earthquake on June 28, 1992.    The temblor was followed a few hours later by a magnitude-6.5 quake in the Big Bear mountain area.     The two San Bernardino County quakes killed one person, injured more than 400 and caused nearly $100 million in damage.", "edition": "Final"}
