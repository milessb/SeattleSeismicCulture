Meanwhile, army chief of staff Gen. Adolfo Blandon called it an ``irresponsible act'' that from 300 to 400 people died last week in the collapse of the Ruben Dario building, which he said had been condemned 21 years ago after another quake.     The five-story Ruben Dario complex _ named after a famous Nicaraguan poet _ was severely damaged during a quake.     Rescue workers estimate that hundreds could still lie crushed under the Ruben Dario, which has begun to give off a stench of decaying flesh in the heat.     Despite a massive international relief effort in the stricken capital, President Jose Napoleon Duarte said thousands of quake victims were still without food or shelter.     Yesterday afternoon a strong jolt, one of more than 300 aftershocks to hit this city since Friday, further damaged a number of buildings and homes. Hardest hit again were the working-class neighborhoods of San Jacinto and Mexicanos.     Hundreds of the homeless are suffering from motion sickness as a result of the almost-constant aftershocks, medical teams report.     Quake survivors have complained to medical teams and reporters that El Salvador's U.S.-supported army is doing nothing to help in rescue work or assistance to homeless families.
