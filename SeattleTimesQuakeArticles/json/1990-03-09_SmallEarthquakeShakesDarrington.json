Chris Jonientz-Trisler at the University of Washington geophysics laboratory in Seattle said the temblor was centered about eight miles west-southwest of Darrington in north Snohomish County. It occurred at 2:11 p.m.        She said several residents reported feeling the quake.        The area has been active with earthquakes in the past, but yesterday's quake was the biggest in the past several years, said Jonientz-Trisler.        She said several aftershocks were felt, including a pair of about 2.5 on the Richter measure of ground movement.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake of 3.5 can cause slight damage in a local area.", "edition": "Final"}
