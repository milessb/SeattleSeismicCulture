Although the 34-year-old campus isn't used as a full-fledged high school anymore, various community groups and youth clubs will be sent elsewhere now that the district has decided to close those buildings because of a high risk of seismic and structural damage.      Superintendent Brian Benzel met with an engineer from the firm of Andersen Bjornstad Kane Jacobs Inc. after the district had commissioned a study of the school's facilities because of increased community use.      \"He advised us that the building would not survive an earthquake of the kind expected to hit the Puget Sound area,\" Benzel said.      Groups using the facilities include the Cascade Symphony and the Sno King Youth Club, which had scheduled 350 basketball games there this season.      The district isn't sure what it will do with the structures, which were victimized by their birthdate Built in 1957, they feature tall walls stacking precast concrete wall panels as high as 30 feet - but only 4 to 5 inches thick - that engineers say likely would buckle in a serious quake.", "edition": "Final"}
