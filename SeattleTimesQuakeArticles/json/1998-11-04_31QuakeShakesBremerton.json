The quake at about 3 p.m. was located about seven miles west-southwest of Bremerton. It had a magnitude of 3.1 and occurred about 14 miles below the surface of the Earth. The University of Washington's seismology lab said the quake was felt widely throughout the area.    One woman said she felt a shuddering and saw the surface of the water rippling when she looked out of the window. Another said she felt a jolt as if a filing cabinet had fallen upstairs.", "edition": "Final"}
