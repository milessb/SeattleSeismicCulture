He said he didn't care about baseball then. ``The Series should be canceled, who cares? There are more important things in life,'' he said         Now just over a year later, we are at war. And now Mr. Kelley says play ball, ``a diversion is what we need.''         I wonder at what level of rationale did Mr. Kelley come to ease his conciousness. I can only conclude one of three things:         --  Because the war waged is 5,000 miles away, it's out of sight, out of mind.         --  Mother Nature is more evil than Saddam Hussein.         --  Mr. Kelley prefers football over baseball.
