There were also three quakes off the coast of Indonesia and two off the remote island nation of Tonga. No damage or injuries were reported. The latest, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake this morning, rattled Tonga at the same time that emergency authorities on the country's islands were broadcasting simulated earthquake alerts as part of the Pacific-wide exercise. The quake was the latest in a string of aftershocks to hit the country since a powerful 7.8 quake on May 4. The National Disaster Office was \"bombarded with questions\" as the quake hit in the midst of the tsunami test, said Tonga's National Disaster Office Deputy Director Mali'u Takai. The largest quake struck Tuesday north of New Zealand, rocking a wide area of the country. New Zealand was among more than two dozen countries taking part in the drill to test the Pacific warning system that has been in place since 1965. During the exercise today, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii sent out warnings about mock earthquakes off the Chilean coast and Luzon island in the northern Philippines powerful enough to set off a tsunami across the vast ocean.", "edition": "Fourth"}
