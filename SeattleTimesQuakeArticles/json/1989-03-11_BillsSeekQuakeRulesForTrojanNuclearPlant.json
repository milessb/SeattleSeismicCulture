An anti-nuclear power group said yesterday the state needs to take steps to determine if the Oregon's only nuclear plant could withstand an earthquake and take precautions if it doesn't.         Lloyd Marbet, and his organization, Forelaws on Board, introduced two bills that would address the problem of an earthquake near Portland General Electric's Trojan nuclear plant north of Portland.         The first bill would require the state Energy Facility Siting Council to adopt safety standards that assure Trojan could withstand a major earthquake.         The second bill would require the council to adopt a plan to evacuate areas within a 50-mile radius of the plant.", "edition": "First"}
