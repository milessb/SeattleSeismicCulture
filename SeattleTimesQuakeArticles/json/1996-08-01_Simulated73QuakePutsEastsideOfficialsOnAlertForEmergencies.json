Fields Grenee", "text": "REDMOND - Last week city officials from Redmond, Bellevue, Kirkland, Mercer Island and Woodinville sat through a 7.3 earthquake - simulated, of course - but aimed at helping them deal with emergencies     The quake was part of a one-week course sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help Eastside communities plan for disasters, including severe storms.      Yesterday, some of the participants met at Redmond City Hall to discuss what they learned and how they can work together.      In the earthquake scenario dreamed up by federal officials, the 75 Eastside representatives - elected officials, emergency departments and volunteer workers - had to pool resources to deal with an imaginary tremor that left 16 dead, 18 missing, 102 injured and damage estimated at $2.3 billion.     Although specific plans for future collaboration haven't been ironed out, the participants thought they'd taken steps toward working together.     \"I'd like to see the Eastside continue to operate as a one-for-all group instead of the `well, we're covered and that's good enough,' mentality,\" Redmond Fire Chief John Ryan said.     Barb Graff, Bellevue's emergency manager, said each of the five communities excel at different emergency skills, but that none is 100 percent prepared.     \"Get prepared,\" she said. \"You will only get so many wake-up calls,\" alluding to recent minor earthquakes that did no real damage but shook up many.", "edition": "Final"}
