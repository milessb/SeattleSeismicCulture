The Oklahoma Corporation Commission said it and the Oklahoma Geological Survey were investigating after the quake, which struck at 7:44 p.m. and was felt as far away as Iowa, Illinois and Texas.  \u201cThe OCC\u2019s Pipeline Safety Department has been in contact with pipeline operators in the Cushing oil storage terminal under state jurisdiction and there have been no immediate reports of any problems,\u201d the commission\u2019s spokesman, Matt Skinner, said in a statement.  Oklahoma has had thousands of earthquakes in recent years, with nearly all traced to the underground injection of wastewater left over from oil and gas production.  Sunday\u2019s quake was centered one mile west of Cushing \u2014 and about 25 miles south of where a magnitude 4.3 quake forced a shutdown of several wells last week.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said initially that Sunday\u2019s quake was of magnitude 5.3 but later lowered the reading to 5.0.  The Cushing Police Department reported \u201cquite of bit of damage\u201d from the earthquake, but details were not immediately available. Photos posted to social media show piles of debris at the base of buildings in the city.  Cushing, with a population of about 7,900, bills itself as the \u201cPipeline Crossroads of the World.\u201d It is home to a massive oil-storage facility that\u2019s touted as the world\u2019s largest.  According to USGS data, there have been 19 earthquakes in Oklahoma in the past week. When particularly strong quakes hit, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission directs well operators to seize wastewater injections or reduce volume.", "edition": "Unknown"}
