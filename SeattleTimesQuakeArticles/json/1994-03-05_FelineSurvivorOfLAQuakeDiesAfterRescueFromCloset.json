Tiffany died five days after she was found.    The cat apparently had run into a neighbor's storage closet during the quake and was accidentally locked inside. She wasn't discovered until Feb. 27, dehydrated, starving and barely conscious.    Animal workers said she must have survived on a dripping sprinkler or rainwater that seeped under the closet door.    But the six weeks without food proved \"too much for her system,\" said Jeanette Beltran of the Animal Clinic of the Santa Clarita Valley.    Efforts were made to feed and rehydrate Tiffany intravenously, and she appeared alert and meowing yesterday morning before dying of respiratory failure and cardiac arrest, Beltran said.", "edition": "Final"}
