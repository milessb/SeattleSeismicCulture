That\u2019s it,\u201d Saint-Elys, who lost his 5-year-old son in the Jan. 12, 2010 earthquake, said about building his dream home on this barren hillside north of Haiti\u2019s capital.  Across the way, down a dirt road, truck driver Mackenson Chery is building his dream brick by brick. Chery\u2019s spacious home is partly walled-in with newly cemented blocks and covered with shining zinc sheeting.  \u201cWe help each other around here,\u201d Chery, 33, said. \u201cIt\u2019s us, the mosquitoes and the dust balls.\u201d  Canaan has become a squatters\u2019 paradise of mushrooming construction of makeshift shacks and concrete homes, with quake victims, land speculators and ordinary Haitians seeking opportunities.  Now, as Haiti marked the fourth anniversary Sunday of the tragedy that left more than 300,000 dead and 1.5 million homeless, this haphazardly built community, born out of the disaster, is in the midst of a rebirth.  And many are concerned that rebirth is more a throwback to the country\u2019s history of disorderly construction instead of the planned, quake-resistant communities that were envisioned.  \u201cThere is a huge construction dynamic happening there,\u201d said Odnell David, Haitian government housing division director. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep it like this, otherwise it will become a massive slum. We have to accompany the people.  \u201cThe people, they had a dream. And In their minds, they did not construct a slum, but rather a city.\u201d  While Canaan has almost all of the amenities of a city \u2014 churches, schools, football fields, mom and pop shops in a commercial district \u2014 it is anything but well-planned.  \u201cWhen I see Canaan, I see the exact replica of Cite Soleil (a slum in the Port-au-Prince area) \u2014 a politics of neglect, a large growing cancer,\u201d said Leslie Voltaire, an urban planner who worked on housing issues shortly after the quake. \u201cIt\u2019s the image of the reconstruction, but by the people and without any resources.\u201d  And that is a disaster waiting to happen in a country where poor construction and urban planning led to the earthquake\u2019s death toll and the collapse of almost 200,000 buildings, say experts.  Canaan has become symbolic of the failings of Haiti\u2019s post-quake response. It was under U.S. pressure to find land for housing that the former government of President Rene Preval declared the large tract of land public use, triggering an illegal occupation by Haitians seeking the promise land.  But instead of free government housing, they found speculators selling them plots without titles.  Four years later, government officials are still haggling with some of the country\u2019s most economically powerful families to gain title to the land, while Haitians continue to stake their claims, marking their parcels with barbwire fencing, wooden frames and unfinished foundations.  Gradually, they have transformed the community\u2019s 2,792 acres from a sea of temporary blue tents to permanent housing valued at $100 million, according to government officials, citing an international evaluation.  And while issues still remain with land tenure, the U.S. Agency for International Development recently agreed to assist Haiti with getting \u201cahead of the curve,\u201d by funding $3 million in technical assistance.  The decision, officials say, is part of a new thinking of allowing Haitians to take control of their own development.  \u201cDonors come in here and they sort of do things for Haitians,\u201d said USAID Mission Director John Groarke. \u201cWe need to move beyond that, and begin to help Haitians to help themselves.\u201d  Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe said there has been progress over the past four years, not just from the more than 90 percent drop in people living in camps, but from the feelings of despair that have turned into hope.  \u201cWe have a country that\u2019s starting to believe that we can get back on our feet,\u201d he said.  Last Monday, in response to the Haitian government and donors touting the overall success of reducing the quake homeless from 1.5 million to 146,573, the Institute for Justice & Democracy (IJD), a Boston-based human rights advocacy group, issued a report highly critical of 16/6, the government\u2019s prized relocation program that provides a one-year rental subsidy to those in camps.  \u201cIt was successful in shutting down the camps,\u201d said Nicole Phillips, a lawyer with the institute, noting that more than half of those tracked had difficulty paying rent after a year.  \u201cBut in terms of being a solution to the housing problem, it\u2019s not,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are in the same situation. It\u2019s quite frustrating to hear both the Haitian and U.S. government talk about solutions that are not necessarily solutions.\u201d  Perhaps the biggest challenge will be gaining the trust of a population that until now has been fending for itself with no basic services from the government.  \u201cThere is no water, there is no electricity\u201d Jean-Luckner Dupervil, a resident and co-head of the local community in Canaan 2. \u201cWhen people have needs, they either do it in a bucket and later bury it, or go into the bushes.\u201d  David acknowledged that turning the area into an organized space won\u2019t be easy, beginning with figuring our who lives there and how many. He was surprised to learn that an aid group was building homes in the community without permission.  \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, but not impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe population is moving faster than the state but everything requires reflection.\u201d  Development experts and urban planners say that Canaan is the logical continuation of Haiti\u2019s overpopulated capital.  \u201cThe time is now to do something before it becomes completely uncontrollable,\u201d said Sandrine Capelle-Manuel, program coordinator in Haiti for UN Habitat, which is advising the government on the issue. \u201cThere is a possibility to make that a real city and not a Cite Soleil in five years.\u201dCaption:  Relatives attend a memorial service Sunday in Titanyen, north of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, honoring family members who died in the Jan. 12, 2010 earthquake that killed more than 300,000 people and left 1.5 million homeless.
