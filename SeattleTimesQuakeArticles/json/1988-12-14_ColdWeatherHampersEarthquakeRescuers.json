All flights between Yerevan, the Armenian capital, and the disaster area were halted by rain, snow and fog, and the forecast was worsening. The weekend was expected to bring more snow and up to 45-mph winds.         About 5,400 people have ben pulled from buildings wrecked in the Dec. 7 quake, which officials say killed at least 55,000 people, injured 13,000 and left 500,000 homeless.         The survivors ``are almost totally isolated in the cold,'' said Dr. Bernard Mankikian, who returned to Paris after visiting Spitak, a city that was destroyed by the quake.", "edition": "Third"}
