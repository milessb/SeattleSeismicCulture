A team of four American architects, including Tacoma architect Del Hobbs, arrived in San Francisco yesterday from a trip to Mexico City, where they offered help to architects working to rebuild the city.       Also, a coalition of 20 public and private Seattle-area schools is putting the finishing touches on ``QUAKEAID,'' an all-city dance scheduled for next month at the Exhibition Hall to raise $14,000 for earthquake victims.       ``It's a show of support by Seattle schools to help the victims of the earthquake,'' said Peter Schwab, one of five seniors at the Bush School who is organizing the Nov. 9 event.         ``We feel strongly here at Bush about our connections with the Mexican people,'' he said, explaining he spent three months last spring as an exchange student in a town two hours north of Mexico City.         Mexicana Airline has announced it will accept shipments free, on a space available basis, from such groups as government agencies, relief agencies and medical supply companies.", "edition": "Fourth"}
