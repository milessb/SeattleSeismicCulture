The quake occurred at 6:46 a.m. and was centered about 4 1/2 miles east-southeast of Woodburn, just north of Salem, according to officials at the University of Washington, which monitors Pacific Northwest earthquake activity.     The quake was \"fairly deep\" - about 18 miles underground - meaning it was \"probably widely felt but that the shaking was not that strong in any particular place,\" said Stephen Malone, a UW seismologist.    Lou Clark, spokesman for the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, said the state gets small earthquakes frequently.     The quake mostly affected Clackamas, Marion and Washington counties in the outlying areas of Salem and Portland. Oregon State Police had no reports of injuries or significant damage.     \"This is the type of event that could have some aftershocks,\" Malone said, but he added they likely will be too mild to be felt by people.     There have been 12 other earthquakes this year in the Woodburn area. The largest was magnitude 2.7 on Feb. 24, which cracked plaster at Oregon City High School.", "edition": "Final"}
