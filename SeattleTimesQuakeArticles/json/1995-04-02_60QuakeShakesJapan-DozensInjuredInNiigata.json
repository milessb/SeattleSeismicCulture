The quake, centered in the Sea of Japan off the coast of Niigata, had a preliminary magnitude of 6.0 Richter. It was felt as a faint rumble in Tokyo, 160 miles away.    At least three people were seriously injured - two with broken bones and a third who was severely burned by boiling water that spilled. Most of the victims, however, received only minor injuries.    One woman was covered in rubble after part of a historic mansion fell on her. She was hospitalized, but police said her injuries were not believed to be severe.    Eleven buildings were destroyed and another 447 were partially damaged, police said.    Police said 290 people sought shelter overnight in public buildings.    A moderate aftershock shook the Niigata region today. The aftershock this morning had a preliminary magnitude of 5.2, but no additional damage or injuries were reported.    The quake was the strongest in Niigata since a 7.5 quake in 1964 killed 26 people and damaged thousands of buildings.    A quake of 6 is considered capable of causing widespread damage near the epicenter.    The earthquake that devastated western Japan on Jan. 17 had a magnitude of 7.2. It killed 5,500 people in the port city of Kobe, about 300 miles from NiigataCaption:  PHOTONIIGATA NIPPO / AP: A TV CREW CLAMBERS THROUGH THE DEBRIS OF A HISTORIC SITE DAMAGED BY YESTERDAY'S QUAKE IN NORTHERN JAPAN.", "edition": "Final"}
