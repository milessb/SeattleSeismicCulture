Bill Mattison, 33, of Vail, Colo, was in a tent at the main base camp on Kahiltna Glacier when the quake hit Tuesday night.     \"Then all of a sudden we saw a 500-foot wall of snow coming at us,\" he said. \"There was nothing we could do. There was just this incredible wall of ice dust . . .     \"We thought for sure we were going to be buried. We thought it was the end.\"     Mattison was among 123 climbers on the 20,320-foot mountain. He believes it was a miracle no one was killed or injured.      The avalanche stopped just short of the camp.", "edition": "Final"}
