The magnitude 6.5 quake late Monday struck 30 villages populated by no more than 4,000 people, state radio reported. Rescue efforts and damage assessments were being hampered by downed phone lines and landslides that have blocked access to some villages, official media cited officials as saying. \"The area was mountainous, and many roads have been blocked,\" Mohammad Barzang, a local official, told state radio. \"From early morning we have sent loaders and bulldozers to open the roads.\" Almost exactly seven years ago in the same region, a catastrophic 6.6 earthquake struck the nearby city of Bam, killing more than 25,000 people.Caption:  photoHamid Sadeghi / The Associated Press: A woman cries over the shrouded bodies of three children who were killed in an earthquake at the village of Chah Ghanbar, in the Kerman province, in southeastern Iran on Tuesday.", "edition": "Fourth"}
