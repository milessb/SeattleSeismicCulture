Insuring a brick home, which is less flexible and more prone to damage than wood, would cost $6-$9 per $1,000 of value in western Washington, or about $5.25 east of the Cascades.     Costs may be discounted if you also have purchased broader coverage on personal property by installing deadbolt locks, fire extinquishers and smoke alarms.     Earthquake insurance is also available to renters.     Because it is designed for major damage rather than cracks, most earthquake insurance generally carries a deductible of 5 to 10 percent of the home's value.     The Insurance Information Institute has prepared three publications: \"Taking Inventory,\" a consumer guide to determine the value of the contents of your home; \"Settling Insurance Claims After a Disaster,\" which helps consumers understand the claims process, and \"How to Survive a Catastrophe,\" a guide for small businesses.
