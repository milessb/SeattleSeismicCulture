Badshah was devastated to learn that Ahmedabad, where he studied and lived before immigrating to the U.S., was among the areas most severely hit. By afternoon, he still knew nothing of the fate of many friends, colleagues and relatives back home, but he threw himself into action. \"We said, `Let's not wait for a day, let's try to get it going,' \" said Badshah, who is now working with CARE to raise relief money. \"We know there will be needs.\" Through contacts he has made in the Indian community and through his company, Digital Partners, a nonprofit organization that links technology and social services, Badshah is organizing a relief effort. \"Right now we are concentrating on how to mobilize the Indian community right here. And what I would very much like to see happen is that every person in the Indian community would see fit to contribute to the effort, even if it were only a dollar,\" Badshah said. \"From there, we could appeal to the larger community.\" Badshah estimated there are about 20,000 Indians living in the Puget Sound area. He said his group is seeking to raise money that will be funneled to established organizations in the Indian subcontinent that will use those funds to purchase supplies such as blankets, tents, food and  purified water. For more information or to make a donation, Badshah can be reached at 425-898-9739 or by e-mail at       abadshah@msn.com.
