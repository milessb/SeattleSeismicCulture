Chris Jonientz-Trisler said the quake had a magnitutde of 2.7 on the Richter scale and was centered about 20 miles northwest of Mount Rainier.        She said the center had been receiving calls from near Enumclaw and the area near Orting and South Prairie.        ``It was minor enough that most people, even if they felt it, might pass it off as something else,'' she said.        No injuries or serious damage were reported.", "edition": "Second"}
