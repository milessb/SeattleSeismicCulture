The warning was lifted an hour later. There were no immediate reports of injury or damage in the 6.5-magnitude temblor centered 100 miles southeast of Sumbawa island, officials said. Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago, is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the so-called Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" an arc of volcanos and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin. In December 2004, a massive earthquake struck off Sumatra island and triggered a tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people in a dozen countries, including 160,000 people in Indonesia's westernmost province of Aceh alone.", "edition": "Fourth"}
