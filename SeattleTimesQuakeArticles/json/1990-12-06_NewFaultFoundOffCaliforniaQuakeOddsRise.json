This makes an earthquake of about magnitude 7 a real possibility, said UCLA seismologist David D. Jackson at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union.        Jackson estimates that the new evidence for the fault raises the estimate of overall quake risk from a known fault in Southern California by at least 50 percent. Before this new evidence, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated the risk of a quake of magnitude 7 or higher in Southern California at 60 percent over the next 30 years, or 10 percent within the next five years.        The San Francisco Bay Area earthquake Oct. 18, 1989, measured a magnitude 7.1.        The findings, which have yet to be confirmed officially by the U.S. Geological Survey, would boost the earthquake estimates to 90 percent and 15 percent, respectively.        Jackson and his colleagues found evidence of the fault's existence after analyzing data from an array of ground instruments.", "edition": "Final"}
