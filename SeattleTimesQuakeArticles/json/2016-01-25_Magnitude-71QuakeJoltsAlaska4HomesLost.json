There were no reports of injuries, but four homes were lost to explosions or fire after the quake.  Alaska\u2019s state seismologist, Michael West, called it the strongest earthquake in the state\u2019s south-central region in decades.  Alaska often has larger or more powerful earthquakes, such as a 7.9 last year in the remote Aleutian Islands.  \u201cHowever, last night\u2019s earthquake is significant because it was close enough to Alaska\u2019s population centers,\u201d West said, adding that aftershocks could continue for weeks.  The earthquake was widely felt by Anchorage residents. But the Anchorage and Valdez police departments said they hadn\u2019t received any reports of injury or significant damage.  The earthquake struck at about 1:30 a.m. Alaska time and was centered 53 miles west of Anchor Point in the Kenai Peninsula, which is about 160 miles southwest of Anchorage, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.  Two homes in Kenai were destroyed in gas-leak explosions and the other two were fully engulfed before firefighters determined it was safe enough from gas for them to enter the homes, Kenai battalion chief Tony Prior said.  He said firefighters focused on keeping the flames from those homes from spreading to nearby houses.  \u201cNo injuries. Thank God,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second one was a major explosion. We\u2019re fortunate that no one was hurt.\u201d  About 30 homes were evacuated, and some people took shelter at the Kenai National Guard Armory.  Workers with the gas utility were examining the remaining homes Sunday afternoon with the goal of getting displaced residents back in their homes later in the day.  The USGS initially reported the quake as a magnitude-7.1 but downgraded shortly afterward to magnitude-6.8 before raising it back to 7.1.  \u201cSome earthquakes have challenges associated with them; they are unusual or hard to monitor,\u201d West said. \u201cThis is neither of them. Southern Alaska is well instrumented, and this earthquake is of the style and type that we would expect in this area.\u201d  The biggest aftershock Sunday was 4.7, and West said a magnitude-5 or magnitude-6 aftershock is possible.  There were reports of scattered power outages from the Matanuska Electric Association and Chugach Electric in the Anchorage area.  The Homer Electric Association reported on its website that about 4,800 customers were without power early Sunday in the Kenai Peninsula.  The Alaska Department of Transportation reported on its Facebook page that there was road damage near the community of Kasilof, on the Kenai Peninsula.Caption:  Items that fell  from the shelves litter the aisles inside a Safeway store after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska on Sunday.
