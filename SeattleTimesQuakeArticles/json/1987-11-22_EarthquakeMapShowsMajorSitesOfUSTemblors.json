The U.S. Geological Survey prepared the map, showing locations of quakes measuring 2.5 or more on the Richter scale in the 48 contiguous states. In addition, major geological boundaries and faults are shown on the map, titled ``Seismicity Map of the Coterminous United States and Adjacent Areas, 1975-1984.''         The map, GP-984, costs $3.10, plus $1 per order for postage and handling, and can be purchased from the Map Distribution Section, U.S. Geological Survey, Federal Center, Box 25286, Denver, Colo. 80225.", "edition": "Weekend"}
