But he said some older ones, such as Panther Lake Elementary, require further study to see if features that appear in building plans, such as roof tie-downs and reinforced masonry, actually exist.     Some schools that were built 50 years ago are likely to be seriously damaged in a quake but won't collapse, Leland said.   Leland said most of the buildings are wood-frame and one-story, posing less danger in a quake.   Leland said the report \"will give us guidance as to whether or not there's a high enough level of concern about a particular building that would drive us to do a design fix", "edition": "Final"}
