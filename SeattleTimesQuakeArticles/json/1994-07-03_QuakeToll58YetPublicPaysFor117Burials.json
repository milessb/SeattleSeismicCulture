The state has awarded federally funded, disaster-related funeral grants - up to $6,000 for burial and $2,500 for cremation - for 117 people, including one man who hanged himself over the loss of his job from the magnitude 6.8 quake.    The deceased for whom grants were given ranged in age from a prematurely born baby to a 94-year-old heart-attack victim. More than half the deaths were caused by heart attacks that followed the earthquake or aftershocks.    So far, the total bill to taxpayers is $431,129, and 138 requests for funeral grants are pending.    If a doctor determines the death to be disaster-related, \"we don't question it,\" said Liz Brady of the California Department of Social Services.", "edition": "Final"}
