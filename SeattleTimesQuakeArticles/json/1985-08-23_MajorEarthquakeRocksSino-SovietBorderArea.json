Don Kelly, a spokesman for the survey, said scientists at the agency's worldwide earthquake detection center in Golden, Colo., recorded the quake at 5:42 a.m. PDT.        Preliminary information puts the center of the earthquake about 325 miles east of Tashkent, a city in Soviet central Asia, Kelly said.        ``Earthquakes of this magnitude are capable of causing serious damage in populated areas, but no reports of damage or injuries have been received so far,'' he said.        Kelly said this was the strongest earthquake anywhere in the world since the magnitude 7.8 quake that took at least 219 lives in Chile on March 3, 1985.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude, so a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.        An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight local damage; 4, moderate damage; 5, considerable damage; 6, severe damage. A 7 is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.", "edition": "Fourth"}
