Meanwhile, Pakistan and India opened a third crossing through their disputed Kashmir frontier as part of limited cooperation between the nuclear rivals since the Oct. 8 quake. But it involved only a ceremonial swap of aid as with the previous two openings. Also Saturday, calm returned to a makeshift refugee camp in Muzaffarabad a day after police used bamboo canes and rifle butts to break up a march by survivors protesting eviction from the public park where they had been living. Pakistani police said they had no immediate plans to move the camp residents. U.N. and Pakistani health officials leading the immunization drive in Pakistan's portion of Kashmir are racing to protect children before the region's savage winter strikes, starting in the most remote towns hit by the quake and working their way toward larger hubs. \"Now, the mourning period is over, and everybody is ready to move forward to make sure that those who carry the future will be protected,\" said Dr. Edward Hoekstra, a senior health adviser for UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency. \"We are starting in the most inaccessible areas in case the weather turns bad in the next two weeks.\" In the aid transfer at the Pakistan-India border, porters from either side walked across a bridge over the Neelum River, bringing sacks of rice and blankets. Kashmiri villagers squatted on the rocky banks on either side, sometimes waving at each other.", "edition": "Fourth"}
