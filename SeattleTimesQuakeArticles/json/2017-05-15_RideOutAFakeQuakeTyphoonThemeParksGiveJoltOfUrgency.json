Guided by the philosophy that experience is the best teacher, Japan wants its citizens to know what it will feel like when the ground under their feet starts to heave \u2014 and how to protect themselves. So cities across the country have constructed disaster education centers that combine theme-park-style simulations with sober lessons in survival.  Many of the more than 60 centers feature large shake tables where visitors can ride out fake quakes as powerful as the real thing. In some centers, visitors navigate life-size dioramas of crushed cars and teetering power poles while being quizzed on the best response to dangerous situations. Typhoons, floods and fires get hands-on treatment as well.  The centers even earn high marks from tourists on travel sites like TripAdvisor.  Some civic leaders in Seattle have long wanted to import the concept to quake-prone Western Washington, where many residents have only a vague understanding of the risks and tend to shrug off the nagging knowledge that they really ought to put together an emergency kit ... one of these days.  \u201cWe thought something like this in Seattle might help light a fire under people and government,\u201d said   Bill Stafford.  Now retired, Stafford was director of the Trade Development Alliance of Greater Seattle a decade ago when he visited a disaster learning center in southern Japan and was stunned to see a line of kids and parents stretching across the parking lot.  Stafford assumed the adults were dragging their kids to an educational outing, but it turned out to be the other way around.  \u201cEvery year, every student in the schools has to visit \u2014 and they bring their parents,\u201d Stafford said.  Washington Gov. Jay Inslee visited Kobe\u2019s Disaster Reduction and Human Renovation Institution in 2015 and came away with one image seared into his memory: a vertical banner, several stories tall, that marks the height of past tsunamis and the expected size of a future tsunami from Japan\u2019s infamous Nankai Subduction Zone.  With a similar quake and tsunami looming on the Cascadia Subduction Zone off the Washington coast, Inslee said he left convinced that one of the best ways to save lives is to educate coastal residents about where \u2014 and how \u2014 to evacuate before a wall of water slams into the shore.  \u201cYou stand there and see a wave 60 feet high in the atrium of that building, and you look at the devastation to the community,\u201d Inslee said last week at a meeting of his Resilient Washington Subcabinet. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-bending \u2014 the forces involved in a tsunami.\u201d  Efforts in Washington  Urged by Stafford and other advocates, the Seattle City Council commissioned a study of Japan\u2019s disaster- education centers in 2007. A proposal emerged to build a facility at Seattle Center in conjunction with the Pacific Science Center. Then the recession hit, and the plans were shelved.  Stafford hasn\u2019t given up, though.  Washington lags other earthquake-prone states in many   aspects of preparedness, including evaluation of school safety and upgrades of dangerous brick buildings. If people could experience the visceral jolt of being rattled on a shake table or of picking their way through a re-creation of a post-quake Seattle, they might take the risks more seriously and push the government to act, Stafford said.  \u201cIf you had adults and kids going through, and new employees at companies and schoolteachers all getting the training, it would start to raise the bar on what we should be doing to prepare,\u201d he said.  Like many of Japan\u2019s disaster parks and centers, Kobe\u2019s relies on video to immerse visitors in the experience of an earthquake and its aftermath.  The tour starts with a film that chillingly re-creates scenes from the 1995 quake that devastated the city, toppling elevated roadways and killing more than 6,000 people. Visitors exit the theater into a nightmarish model of an urban block with buildings tilting on their foundations and fires flaring in the distance.  Volunteer docent Nanami Yoshimoto lived through the quake but lost family friends. At first, just watching the film at the museum was so traumatic it gave her a headache. But like many older Japanese people, she feels a responsibility to keep the memories alive and share lessons learned.  \u201cWe can\u2019t escape from quakes in Japan,\u201d she said. \u201cHave to hand it down ... to the next generation.\u201d  But there\u2019s nothing fatalistic in the centers\u2019 messages. The emphasis is on personal responsibility and action: how to make your way safely through wreckage, how to find the closest shelter.  \u201cIf you have no knowledge about what to expect (from an earthquake), once it occurs people will panic,\u201d said Kenji Hode, chief of the Ikebukuro Life Safety Learning Center, one of three operated by the Tokyo Fire Department. \u201cIf people experience a realistic disaster here, then they will be equipped with knowledge about how to handle the situation.\u201d  \u201cTerrifying\u201d simulation  About 70,000 people visit his center every year, Hode said. Most are school kids, but many companies send their employees \u2014 including foreigners who may not be aware that Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries on Earth.  The quake simulator is the star attraction here. Visitors sit around a dining-room table while a staff member dials up quakes that range from mild temblors to tooth-rattling monsters. Earlier this spring, a group of visitors took their seats to experience a magnitude-9 subduction zone quake, like the one that spawned the deadly 2011 Tohoku tsunami and which is expected someday off the Washington coast.  When the shaking began, the visitors dived under the table. Images of destruction from the 2011 quake flashed across wide screens that mimicked picture windows. A roaring din filled the room. Instead of diminishing, the shaking intensified until the table itself started dancing across the floor.  \u201cThat was terrifying,\u201d said one participant.  Across town, Tokyo\u2019s Rinkai Disaster Prevention Park offers the closest thing to a Universal Studios-type experience. Visitors enter what looks like a department-store elevator. As the car descends, a violent tremor causes it to lurch side to side. The doors open onto a darkened labyrinth of corridors.  Visitors grope their way to an exit, which leads to a scene of mayhem. Sirens wail. Severed power lines spark. Air-conditioning units two stories up look as if the next aftershock will send them tumbling to the street.  Visitors are guided by Nintendo consoles dangling from straps around their necks. At each stop, the consoles pose questions: Should you try to rescue that person calling from under a pile of rubble or go for help? What\u2019s the best way to shut off a gas meter?  When they\u2019ve finished the immersive experience, visitors can wander through exhibits on plate tectonics, past earthquakes and personal preparedness. One display includes a half-dozen types of emergency toilets, ranging from a bucket filled with cat litter to a tented cabana with a holding tank.  Most of the centers also offer hands-on experience using fire extinguishers to douse simulated fires. Tokyo\u2019s third center, Honjo Disaster Learning Center, boasts the city\u2019s only typhoon room. Visitors don slickers and hang onto safety bars before being lashed by hurricane-force winds and rain.  The hands-on centers are just part of Japan\u2019s disaster education efforts, which also include flamboyant public drills. The city of Tokyo offers a wildly popular, 323-page survival manual with tips on how to bandage a head wound with tights and make an emergency stove from foil and cooking oil. The country\u2019s goal is to reduce casualties and damage from natural disasters by half.  Not much in Northwest  It\u2019s hard to quantify the impact of the disaster-education centers, said Kevin Ronan, a psychologist at the University of Australia who specializes in hazards and disasters. But several studies of disaster-education programs for children suggest that Japan\u2019s approach is promising, particularly if children are actively engaged in solving challenges and sharing the information with their families, he said in an email.  Turkish officials were so impressed with Japan\u2019s disaster centers that they built one in the capital city of Ankara.  But there\u2019s nothing like it in the Pacific Northwest.  Oregon\u2019s Museum of Science and Industry has a small shake room, currently being revamped, where visitors experience a tame version of a fake quake. The California Academy of Science\u2019s shake room simulator is similar, but is part of a large exhibit on earthquakes and plate tectonics.  Seattle\u2019s Pacific Science Center doesn\u2019t have an exhibit dedicated to earthquakes. A large sphere can be used to display recent quakes and teach about seismic forces, and a foot-square shake table allows kids to build basic structures and see how they respond to shaking, said Diana Johns, vice president of exhibits.  She took part in the early discussion of a disaster-education center in Seattle \u2014 and was sorry to see the idea fizzle.  \u201cPersonally, as a citizen, I think we should have something like that, because this is where we live,\u201d Johns said.  Former Seattle City Councilmember Richard Conlin, who advocated for a center, agrees. But at the time, city officials couldn\u2019t find a way to pay for it and the federal Department of Homeland Security wasn\u2019t willing to chip in.  \u201cIn a sense it\u2019s a matter of life and death,\u201d Conlin said. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got a big earthquake coming ... at some point, and people need to be both prepared and ready to take action.\u201dCaption:  Visitors to the typhoon room at Tokyo\u2019s Honjo Disaster Learning Center can don slickers and grip safety bars before getting blasted with typhoon-force winds and rain. It\u2019s just one of the preparedness theme parks that draw lines of tourists around Japan.

A visitor strains to open a door that simulates the resistance created by standing water. Sandi Doughton / The Seattle Times During a visit to Japan, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee was struck by this banner, which shows the height of past tsunamis in the region and the expected tsunami height from a major quake on Japan\u2019s Nankai Subduction Zone, which is very similar to the Cascadia Subduction Zone. The banner is in Kobe\u2019s Disaster Reduction and Human Renovation Institution, one of 60 such centers across Japan devoted to earthquake preparedness and education.
