It struck about 7:50 p.m. PDT with its epicenter about 120 miles northwest of Eureka, Calif., said Paul Whitmore, a geophysicist with the Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska.     He estimated the quake was about 70 miles off the Oregon Coast. Reports indicated it could be felt as far inland as Eugene to the north and Sacramento to the south.      Whitmore said no tsunami warning was issued because of the relatively small size and far-off location of the earthquake. \"We wouldn't be worried unless it was of a magnitude of over 7,\" he said.     There were no reports of any injuries or damage in the five southernmost Oregon counties covered by the Oregon State Police office in Medford.     The Coast Guard stations in Coos Bay and North Bend both reported the quake but said there were no problems or distress calls.", "edition": "Final"}
