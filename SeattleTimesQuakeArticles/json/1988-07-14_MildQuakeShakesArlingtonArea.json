No injuries or damage were reported.        The quake at 10:02 a.m. measured 3 on the Richter scale of ground motion, said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the UW geophysics center.        Every increase of one number on the scale means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.", "edition": "Third"}
