The quake at 9:04 p.m. measured 5.4 on the Richter scale in a preliminary reading, said geophysicist Bob Hammond.        ``It was widely felt in the Fairbanks-Fort Yukon area,'' Hammond said. He said the earthquake was felt strongly at Fairbanks International Airport, while a pump station on the trans-Alaska pipeline also reported the shock.        The epicenter was about 110 miles north of Fairbanks and 80 miles southwest of Fort Yukon, near Beaver in Yukon Flats wildlife refuge, Hammond said.        Four aftershocks were detected; the strongest, at 9:17 p.m., measured 3.7.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 6.4 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 5.4.        An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause considerable damage, 6 severe damage.        The catastrophic Good Friday earthquake in Alaska in 1964 measured 8.4 and killed 131 people.", "edition": "Final"}
