There were no reports of damage or injuries. The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 7.1, hit at 6:39 a.m. and was centered just below the ocean bottom off the east coast of Japan's main island of Honshu, Japan's Meteorological Agency said. Small tsunami waves measuring 12 and 20 inches hit the coastal city of Ofunato and smaller waves hit at least four other towns. Tsunami waves \u2014 generated by earthquakes \u2014 are often barely noticeable in the ocean but can rise to great heights once they arrive at shore. Ross Stein, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., said the swell amounted to \"a surfable tsunami.\"", "edition": "Fourth"}
