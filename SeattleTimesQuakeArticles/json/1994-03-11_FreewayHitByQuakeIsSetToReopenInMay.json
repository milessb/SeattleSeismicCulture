By working around the clock, seven days a week, the contractors repairing the Santa Monica Freeway have pushed work more than a month ahead of schedule.    The freeway, which carries 341,000 cars a day, was closed at two points after sections of the elevated roadway collapsed during the quake.    State officials set a June 24 deadline for completion of the repairs but offered the contractors incentives for finishing early.      They will get bonuses of $200,000 a day if they beat the deadline but will be penalized by the same amount for each day beyond the deadline.    If the work is done 30 days ahead of time, the contractors will receive an extra $6 million on the $15 million contract.      But state and company officials say that some of the bonus will be eaten up by the expense of paying crews to work extra hours.    The Jan. 17 quake damaged freeways in 200 locations.      Seventy-eight bridges suffered moderate to major damage.      Six bridges collapsed, causing closures and major detours.    For commuters, the crippled Santa Monica Freeway has forced traffic onto crowded streets between Santa Monica and downtown Los Angeles.", "edition": "Final"}
