The quake, which measured 6.6 on the Richter scale, struck about 7:50 p.m. Friday. It was centered about 65 miles west of the Oregon-California border and was felt from Eugene to Sacramento, Calif.     No injuries or damage were reported.     Malone said the strongest aftershocks usually measure at most one full magnitude less than the main shock. That means aftershocks from Friday's temblor could reach an intensity of 5.5, he said.     The earthquake Friday was similar in location and characteristics to a 7.0 magnitude quake that shook the Northwest on Nov. 8, 1980. After that quake, aftershocks were felt in Humboldt Bay and Eureka, Calif., Malone said.     Chris Jonientz-Trisler, a seismic analyst at the university, said the earthquake was another in a familiar pattern for geologists. Quakes measuring between 4.0 and 6.0 are recorded every few months or so, she said.     \"They're very identifiable to anyone with a practiced eye on the seismograph,\" she said.     Malone said the quake is unrelated to an increase in volcanic activity at Mount Unzen in Japan and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. Although both are part of the Pacific Rim, the recent activity is a coincidence.", "edition": "Final"}
