It's ``an almost sure thing. . . . We just don't know where or when,'' he said.        Beavers' warning is detailed in a new study of the earthquake hazard to energy systems, published by the American Association of Engineering Societies.        Although earthquakes were relatively common in the eastern states in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, few have occurred in this century, Beavers said. This absence raises fears that tension is building on rocks deep underground, waiting to be released, he said.        Three of the country's most powerful earthquakes occurred in the area of New Madrid, Mo., near the Mississippi River in 1811 and 1812, Beavers said.        The problem in the East is potentially greater than in California, where quakes are more frequent and get more attention. There, many buildings are designed for the stresses of quakes, while in the eastern states few are, he said.", "edition": "First"}
