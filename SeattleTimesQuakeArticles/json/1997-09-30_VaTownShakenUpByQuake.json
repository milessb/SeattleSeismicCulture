Or that the roof had caved in. Or that a sonic boom had rolled by.    Turns out it was just an earthquake.    At 1:45 p.m. EDT, a quake registering 2.5 on the Richter scale jostled  Manassas, according to officials with the U.S. Geological Survey. Residents were stirred but not quite shaken: No injuries, collapsed buildings or broken dishes were reported.    In short, it was the day the earth almost stood still.    \"It's what we would call a very minor seismic event,\" said John Minsch of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Golden, Colo. \"If this happened in California, no one would probably even notice.\"     But in Northern Virginia, the term \"earth-shaking\" is not generally meant literally. So when the ground shuddered yesterday in Manassas, about 45 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., residents wandered outside their homes and workplaces and flooded emergency dispatchers with telephone calls asking what had happened.      Fire and rescue officials checked to see if there had been an explosion.       \"We don't have these kind of events very often,\" said Kevin McGee, spokesman for Prince William County Fire and Rescue. \"I can't remember any.\"     Nor can USGS officials, who found no Manassas entries in their earthquake database, which dates to 1970.    But earthquakes are not unheard of in Virginia and Maryland.     Martin Chapman of  Virginia Tech's Seismological Observatory in Blacksburg said the state has two active seismic areas. One runs along the James River between Charlottesville and Richmond; the other is  in southwestern Virginia.", "edition": "Final"}
