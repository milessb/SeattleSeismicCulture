From Tacoma to the Tri-Cities, the scenarios lay out potential impacts from a major earthquake on each region\u2019s most dangerous fault.  \u201cSome level of earthquake damage is very plausible virtually anywhere in Washington,\u201d said Tim Walsh, geologic hazards chief for the state Department of Natural Resources.  Though hypothetical and incomplete, the scenarios are sobering:  \u2022 A quake similar to one that hit about 1,100 years ago on the Seattle Fault could kill more than a thousand people, injure more than 17,000 and cause $31 billion in damage to buildings, bridges, roads and utilities.  \u2022 Hundreds would perish in a magnitude 7.4 quake on a fault that runs through Everett, and nearly 300,000 buildings would be damaged.  \u2022 If the fault that passes near Tacoma unleashes a magnitude 7.1 quake the next time it ruptures, nearly 12,000 households could be displaced and more than 6,000 people injured.  \u2022 In the Walla Walla area, a magnitude 6.8 quake on what\u2019s called the Hite fault could leave more than 19,000 households without water and destroy more than 1,300 buildings.  The modeling, which also maps out ground-shaking, was aimed mainly at helping emergency managers get a handle on what to plan for, Walsh said.  \u201cYou can get a better idea of whether electrical substations might go down, where you might see (soil) liquefaction, where the roadways might be damaged,\u201d he said.  Most Northwesterners are familiar with the threat from quakes like 2001\u2019s Nisqually quake, which originated more than 30 miles under the Puget Sound region.  The Northwest coast is   also vulnerable to megaquakes and tsunamis like the one that devastated Japan in 2011.  But the same tectonic forces that spawn deep quakes and coastal megaquakes have also created f shallow faults, mostly running east and west, from the Canadian border to the Columbia River.  \u201cThere\u2019s a whole host of these faults,\u201d said Craig Weaver, of the U.S. Geological Survey. \u201cThey just don\u2019t get the public attention that the big guys do.\u201d  But for many urban areas \u2014 such as Seattle, Tacoma, Everett and Olympia \u2014 shallow fault quakes have the potential to be the most damaging type because   the force is not blunted by depth or distance.  Shallow quakes also pose the greatest hazard east of the Cascades.  The consequences of a major quake on the Seattle Fault, which slices from Bremerton to the Cascade foothills, were modeled in great detail in a 2005 analysis. Field studies found that the fault last ruptured in about 900 AD \u2014 an upheaval that   thrust shorelines 30 feet in the air and triggered a tsunami in Puget Sound.  But for many of the state\u2019s lesser-known faults, the 20 new scenarios represent the first systematic attempt to quantify casualties and damage.  The geologists picked realistic, worst-case quakes for most of the faults, based on everything they\u2019ve learned from trenching, aerial surveys, and magnetic and gravity measurements that \u201csee\u201d below the surface.  It\u2019s harder to estimate how frequently big quakes may strike, because geologists don\u2019t have a long historic record for many of the faults, Weaver said. But in general, it appears that some part of Washington gets rattled by a major quake on a shallow fault every 500 to 1,000 years, he added.  The damage estimates were generated from a program called HAZUS, created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The version used tends to underestimate damage, because it relies on a simplified estimate of the number and types of buildings in an area and doesn't factor in damage to local roads and bridges.  \u201cIt\u2019s by no means perfect,\u201d said John Schelling, of the Washington Emergency Management Division. \u201cBut it at least provides some estimates.\u201d  Snohomish County, which would bear the brunt of a major quake on the state\u2019s largest shallow fault \u2014 the Southern Whidbey Island Fault \u2014 is using the scenario to fine-tune its preparations.  \u201cWhen that fault breaks, it will impact the entire region,\u201d said John Pennington, the county\u2019s emergency management chief.  Indeed, the new scenario shows that 18 counties would feel the effects of a magnitude 7.4 quake. Dozens of bridges would fall \u2014 something Pennington and his crew are already preparing to deal with by staging resources and designating emergency centers in areas likely to be cut off.  Everett and Snohomish would be particularly hard-hit, because of the prevalence of old, brick buildings, Pennington said. The scenario estimates nearly 1,500 brick structures would be extensively damaged or destroyed.  The damage would displace up to 14,000 households. One of the things Pennington is focused on now is identifying good sites for temporary housing and ways to fast-track building permits.  Collectively and individually, the scenarios offer snapshots of the turmoil that would follow a major quake anywhere in the state:  \u2022 A magnitude 7.3 quake on the Saddle Mountain Fault, which angles between Yakima and Richland, would cause an estimated 1,300 breaks in water, sewer and gas lines.  \u2022 Anacortes and Mount Vernon would experience some of the strongest shaking from a magnitude 7 quake on the Devil\u2019s Mountain fault, leading to 652 casualties and three dozen deaths.  \u2022 A moderate, magnitude 5.5 quake on a fault near Spokane would leave nearly 1,500 buildings at least moderately damaged, at a cost of more than $360 million.  \u2022 The Tacoma Fault scenario forecasts 176 fires triggered by the quake, accounting for $1.7 billion in property damage and displacing more than 21,000 people.  \u2022 A month after the hypothetical Seattle Fault quake, more than 137,000 households would still be without water.  \u2022 Bellingham and Whatcom County would absorb $95 million of the $105 million in property-related losses expected from a magnitude 6.8 quake on the Boulder Creek Fault, near the Canadian border.Memo:  Sandi Doughton at: 206-464-2491 or sdoughton@seattletimes.com", "edition": "Unknown"}
