It was felt from Klamath Falls to Medford, but no damage or injuries were reported.    The epicenter was in almost the same place as a series of quakes that struck six years ago, killing two people.   The epicenter was 13.9 miles west-northwest of Klamath Falls.    In 1993, the tremor measured at magnitude 3.9. Two larger quakes, magnitude 5.9 and 6.0, occurred within a few hours, followed by hundreds of aftershocks over the ensuing months.", "edition": "Final"}
