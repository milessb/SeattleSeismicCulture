Within a few hours, Cascade Geyser, virtually dormant since the late 1800s, began erupting. Vault Geyser, inactive since 1988, began spouting so much water that it cut channels in the sediment surrounding it.    About eight days later, Old Faithful's crowd-pleasing shows became a little harder to predict.    Before the earthquake, Old Faithful was erupting once every 74 minutes. Since then, it has averaged more than 80 minutes between eruptions, the longest interval since record-keeping began in the 1920s.    Once during the winter, rangers watched the geyser wait 115 minutes between eruptions.    Experts are not certain whether the earthquake disturbed nature's plumbing or whether changes in the geysers and their subterranean waterworks caused the quake.    The magnitude 2.2 quake struck on Jan. 9 about a mile from Old Faithful.    Old Faithful has never operated like clockwork. Instead, it erupts for two minutes then waits about an hour to do it again, or it erupts for three to five minutes and then waits about 90 minutes.    \"It's nearly as predictable as it was before - it's just that we've had to change the prediction model,\" said Lynn Stephens, a statistician at Eastern Washington University.Caption:  PHOTOSEATTLE TIMES FILE: OLD FAITHFUL'S ERUPTIONS HAVE BECOME HARDER TO PREDICT.", "edition": "Final"}
