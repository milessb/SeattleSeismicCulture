The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.7, hit at 3:27 a.m. and was centered about 30 miles southeast of McKinley Park, gateway to Denali National Park. The quake was felt as far as 350 miles away, said Bruce Tanner, a seismologist with the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer. In Healy, north of the park, Grandview Bed and Breakfast co-owner Shelly Acteson said the quake knocked nearly everything off walls and shelves. \"Usually they kind of roll, you can kind of hear them coming,\" she said. \"This one sounded like it was kind of mad -- boom, boom, boom.\" The quake was felt by residents in Fairbanks, 85 miles north of the epicenter, and Anchorage, 170 miles to the southwest. The quake struck at a relatively shallow depth of about six miles, which is why it was felt by so many people, said Guy Urban, a geophysicist with the tsunami center. In Talkeetna, about 100 miles southwest of the epicenter, the manager of a general store said the quake sent wine bottles and canned goods crashing to the floor. An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage. The Good Friday earthquake in Alaska that left 131 people dead in 1964 measured a magnitude of 9.2.Caption:  map(GJHC6JLM)The Associated Press: 6.7 quake hits Alaska", "edition": "Fourth"}
