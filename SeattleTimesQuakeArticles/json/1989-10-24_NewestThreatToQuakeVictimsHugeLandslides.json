But they could cause considerable structural damage to the houses and things riding on them.''        Geologists have discovered at least a thousand landslides - which they define as land that has shifted - in the mountains west of San Jose. Some have fallen with dramatic speed, blocking roads and burying houses. But many more are so large and slow-moving that residents of the already devastated area may not realize the ground beneath them is sliding. For those who can feel the earth shift or see the widening fissures in the rain-soaked land, that evidence has caused some despair.        Yesterday's rain measured 2 1/2 inches in some areas.        ``That's all we needed was the damned wind and the rain now,'' said Diane Opalinsky, packing a moving van yesterday with possessions from the quake-damaged Boulder Creek home she and her husband, George, have owned for 11 years. ``We were here during the flood (of 1982), and I know the landslides we had. I told George we're not going to push our luck now. Let's just get out.'", "edition": "Second"}
