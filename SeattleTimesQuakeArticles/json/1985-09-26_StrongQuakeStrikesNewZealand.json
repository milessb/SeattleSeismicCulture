He said the quake struck at 7:31 p.m. (12:31 a.m. PDT).        Earlier, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu reported that the quake had been centered about 500 miles northwest of Wellington, and that its force was 6.5 on the Richter scale. The center said the quake was not strong enough to generate a tsunami, or tidal wave.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in earthquake magnitude.        An earthquake of 6 on the Richter scale can cause severe damage in a local area. The quake that devastated parts of Mexico a week ago was measured at 8.1 on the Richter scale; the quake Friday was 7.5.", "edition": "Fourth"}
