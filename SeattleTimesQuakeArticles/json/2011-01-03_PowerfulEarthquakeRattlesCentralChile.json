The U.S. Geological Survey measured Sunday's quake at 7.1, two-tenths of a point higher than the University of Chile's calculation. The epicenter was near the coastal community of Tirua in the Araucania region. The site is about 385 miles southwest of the capital, Santiago. Hundreds of people reportedly fled in their cars for higher ground, fearing a tsunami like the one that followed an earthquake Feb. 27 that ravaged Concepci\u00f3n to the north. But aside from power and cellphone outages, no major problems were reported Sunday. Last year's magnitude 8.8 earthquake killed 486 people, left 79 missing and caused billions of dollars in damage, official tallies show. Vicente Nunez, director of Chile's National Emergency Office, said there was no danger of a tsunami, an assessment shared by the Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.", "edition": "Fourth"}
