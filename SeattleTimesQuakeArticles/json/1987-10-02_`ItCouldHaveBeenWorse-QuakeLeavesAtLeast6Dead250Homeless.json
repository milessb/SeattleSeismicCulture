Yesterday's disaster, which officials called a dress rehearsal for a ``Big One'' yet to come, killed at least six people and injured more than 100.        United Press International reported seven deaths were blamed on the quake, including a man who was buried alive in a tunnel and one who jumped from his second-story apartment. About 250 were left homeless.        The temblor lasted only 10 to 15 seconds but crumbled dozens of buildings, damaged hundreds of houses and tossed heavy pieces of furniture about like toys. Sixteen aftershocks followed.        Yet, emergency services worked smoothly, traffic flowed, power was quickly restored, and highway improvements completed since the devastating 1971 Sylmar quake minimized damage, officials said.        ``It could have been worse,'' said Mayor Tom Bradley. ``Overall, I think we escaped a major catastrophe, and I'm sure we're grateful for that.''        In a television interview today, Bradley added: ``It was a valuable exercise in terms of our preparation. . . . Within 15 minutes our emergency center was ready in every respect.''        The temblor, which struck at 7:42 a.m. and measured 6.1 on the Richter scale, was centered seven miles east-southeast of downtown Los Angeles at the northwest end of the 30-mile-long Whittier Fault.        The town of Whittier, five miles from the epicenter, suffered the most damage.  Hundreds of homes were damaged in the suburban community where Richard Nixon grew up. At least 170 people spent the night at two shelters.        Broken glass and debris rained into the streets. Thirty buildings collapsed, city officials said.        Mayor Gene Chandler declared a state of emergency.        Mike and Cheryl Verdugo and their 13-month-old daughter, Stephanie, sat on the front lawn of their Whittier house through the night.        ``The side of the house is pretty thrashed. Big chunks of concrete came off the side,'' Verdugo said, adding his baby girl would sleep in the car.        Amid concern about falling debris, authorities sealed off a dozen blocks of the city.        ``The houses up here in the hills are all a mess,'' said Denise Huff, 33, whose ceiling caved in. ``I'm from Ohio, and I'm going back.''        Police patrolled the town of 71,000 for looters, said police Sgt. Charles Plummer, and Gov. George Deukmejian planned to inspect the damage today.        In Los Angeles, where five people were arrested for looting, an anti-looting squad was on patrol downtown. The entire department was on alert, working 12-hour shifts, said Lt. Dan Cooke, a police spokesman.        Rattled residents said they feared the ``Big One,'' a long-predicted massive quake expected to release 1,000 times more energy than yesterday's temblor, which was the strongest since the Sylmar quake that killed 64 in 1971. It registered 6.4 on the Richter scale.        (The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.)        Downtown Los Angeles became a virtual ghost town yesterday as businesses closed and workers were sent home for the day.        The quake was felt as far away as Las Vegas, Nev., 250 miles to the northeast.        In old residential neighborhoods, porches collapsed, chimneys toppled and streets cracked.        Those killed included a 21-year-old California State University-Los Angeles student crushed by a collapsing wall; a 32-year-old man who panicked and leaped from a second-floor window in suburban Maywood; and a 40-year-old construction worker buried under seven feet of earth in a tunnel under construction in the San Gabriel Mountains, officials said.        Heart attacks attributed to the earthquake killed a 69-year-old man during a high-rise building evacuation in Los Angeles; a 72-year-old distraught woman in the city of Bell; and a 20-year-old woman in Covina.        A 70-year-old woman suffered a fatal heart attack in bed at her Irvine home as her husband tried to calm her over the telephone, but authorities said they could not prove the earthquake caused her death.        Nearly 12 hours after the quake, a 30-year-old motorcyclist was killed when his bike slid under a state Department of Transportation truck repairing a freeway near suburban Norwalk, said state Highway Patrol spokesman Lyle Whitten.Caption:  PHOTOAP: TODD FORT, MANAGER OF THE COST PLUS STORE IN GLENDALE, CALIF., SURVEYS DAMAGE AFTER YESTERDAY'S EARTHQUAKE IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA.", "edition": "First"}
