It all started when Italy's revered poet Dante Alighieri cited his 13th century contemporary, whose full name was Cenni di Peppi, in \"The Divine Comedy\" in none too flattering words to illustrate the transience of earthly glory.     \"Cimabue thought that he held the field in painting, but now Giotto is acclaimed and his fame obscured,\" he wrote. Giotto is widely believed to have been Cimabue's pupil.     The words, though apparently harsh, later served to fuel Cimabue's own reputation when commentators seized upon them to show that he had been a great innovator who began the shift towards realism that culminated in the Renaissance.     Fate, however, was not kind to Cimabue.     His acclaimed frescoes in Assisi, which were begun in 1280, had already been badly damaged by the elements over the years.     A impressive Crucifix attributed to him in Florence was ruined by a devastating flood in 1966.     Then, on Friday, the powerful twin earthquakes destroyed much of his work in the basilica.     Ironically, the quakes left the most famous frescoes in the basilica - those by Giotto - cracked but largely intact.", "edition": "Final"}
