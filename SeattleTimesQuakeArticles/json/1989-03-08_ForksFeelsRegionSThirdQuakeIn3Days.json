Quakes were also felt in Western Washington Saturday and Sunday, with Saturday's registering 4.5 on the Richter scale, the biggest quake felt in the region in eight years.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in a local area and one of 4 can cause moderate damage.", "edition": "Final"}
