Ken Johnson, who manages the hot springs, said the flow is up about 20 percent, allowing him to fill the holding tank in about 43 hours, instead of the previous 52 hours. Up to 100,000 gallons of water now flow out of the springs daily. He said the temperature of the water hasn't changed, still bubbling up at 86 to 96 degrees. The changes weren't noticed right away because the quake broke part of the spring's filling system, making water measurement difficult.    Eric Dittmer, a geologist with the Jackson County Groundwater Advisory Committee, said some Rogue Valley residents have reported increased flow from their private wells. The quake's impact on groundwater could help scientists learn more about underground geology. Similar reactions were reported in Klamath Falls in geothermal wells used for heating.", "edition": "Weekend"}
