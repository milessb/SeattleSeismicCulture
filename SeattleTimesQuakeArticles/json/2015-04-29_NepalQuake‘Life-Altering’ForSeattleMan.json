There were boulders, rockfalls and debris sliding down all over the place. ...  If you were in the wrong place, you would be hit by a boulder and be instantly crushed.\u201d  Then, triggered by the quake, an avalanche roared into the valley.  \u201cWe all looked up the valley. We saw this dark cloud coming our direction,\u201d Davenport said Tuesday. \u201cWe were all terrified; we thought this was the end.\u201d  Davenport\u2019s group \u2014 best friend Jim Watt, Watt\u2019s brother Vance, and a porter \u2014   scrambled for cover.  \u201cAnd this cloud came. It was like a windstorm with snow and rock debris.\u201d  He thinks the avalanche took just a minute, maybe two.  It felt like longer.  \u201cVery ominous \u2014 almost a timeless sense to it,\u201d Davenport said.  \u201cThe dead zone where the avalanche hit ... was probably a kilometer and half, two kilometers above us. It decimated Langtang Village. We believe everyone died.\u201d  Covered in about an inch of debris, Davenport felt a moment of relief. Then, \u201cYou start thinking about what do I do next to survive.\u201d  Because they were \u201cteahouse trekking,\u201d the group was traveling light. Davenport was wearing light hiking shoes, a vest and a North Face jacket. They had some snacks and water but weren\u2019t prepared for disaster, he said.  As aftershocks shook beneath and boulders continued to topple down the valley, they navigated their way down to a military outpost where they\u2019d checked in earlier that day.  Covered in \u201csnowy, dusty debris,\u201d the \u201ctrail wasn\u2019t easy to find,\u201d said Davenport.  Still, about 60 foreign trekkers and 150 Nepalis found their way to the outpost, where they all congregated.  \u201cThere were a lot of injuries. Many people who had come down left people who were dead who had been hiking above. The tragedy was unbelievable.\u201d  Two women, who Davenport believes had fled a teahouse without shoes, arrived at the outpost with frostbitten feet.  About 15 soldiers stationed at the military outpost took trekkers and displaced Nepalis in, but there wasn\u2019t enough space. The group had to create rudimentary shelters scattered around the hut. There was nowhere to go, said Davenport, because the route down was destroyed.  Overnight, aftershocks sent more boulders tumbling down the valley. Rain and cold seeped in. Davenport\u2019s fleece sleeping-bag liner already was soaked, but he was able to get a new bag from the Nepali army. Hypothermia, he said, was a real concern.  The collection of people took care of each other as well as they could, sharing what little they had.  \u201cThe level of cooperation between the locals and foreigners was unbelievable on most levels: Making sure people had enough to eat and helping with medical issues ...  it was a beautiful thing.\u201d  The Nepali soldiers \u201cwere able to cook up some weird rice stuff,\u201d said Davenport. \u201cHot tea came around.\u201d That was a  godsend, he said, because, \u201cwe were freezing our asses off.\u201d  Overwhelmed, the Nepali army struggled to meet everyone\u2019s needs. There was no way to communicate, said Davenport. Cell service was down, and a solar-powered satellite phone at the outpost was uncharged.  Rush for helicopters  The next morning, two helicopters flew in.  Jim Watt, who had broken his leg, made it out on one of the first flights.  But  a desperate situation became tense.  \u201cIt was total chaos,\u201d said Davenport. \u201cThe locals would force their way on (to the aid helicopters) and the army couldn\u2019t or didn\u2019t stop it.\u201d  The next day travelers stuck in camp brokered a deal to prioritize evacuating the sick and injured. Still, almost every helicopter landing brought a rush, and a fight, to get aboard.  Meanwhile, Nepalis periodically climbed toward Langtang Village to check on friends and relatives.  \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to believe it had been destroyed,\u201d said Davenport.  They returned wailing, he said.  \u201cI\u2019ve cried more in these four days than I\u2019ve cried since I was a boy,\u201d said Davenport. \u201cIt\u2019s a life-altering event.\u201d  On Monday night, Davenport managed to get on a helicopter. In half an hour, he was back in Kathmandu, where he\u2019s now staying in a guesthouse. Davenport said Jim Watt has been treated and should recover.  \u201cI\u2019m very sleep-deprived. Food was a little hard to find,\u201d he said. But, \u201ccompared to where I was at, this is paradise.\u201d  Next move uncertain  The trip was Davenport\u2019s 50th-birthday present to himself. He quit his job to take an \u201cunauthorized eight-month sabbatical\u201d while his girlfriend taught sociology in Japan.  During the Nepal leg of the trip, Davenport planned a meditation retreat, Buddhist classes and a yoga retreat. He\u2019s not due back in Tokyo until this summer.  His plans interrupted by disaster, he said he may volunteer or continue the trip as planned.  \u201cThe (Buddhist) class I\u2019m supposed to do at the end of this trip is on death and dying. I can\u2019t help but feel like this class isn\u2019t going to be a big deal.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019ve cried more in these four days than I\u2019ve cried since I was a boy. It\u2019s a life-altering event.\u201d  I\u2019ve cried more in these four days than I\u2019ve cried since I was a boy. It\u2019s a life-altering event.\u201d  Greg Davenport  Seattle resident trekking with two friends in Nepal\u2019s Langtang National Park when quake occurred  Still missing  Here are the five known Washington residents who remain unaccounted for in Nepal:  Bailey Meola, 19, and Sydney Schumacher, 19: A fellow hiker last spotted the two Seattle women about 2 p.m. Friday \u2014 22 hours before the earthquake \u2014 as they trekked up Kyangin Ri, a peak above the village of Kyanjin Gompa in Langtang National Park. Schumacher\u2019s mother believes the missing women may be stranded with dozens of others in the Buddhist village. The women are traveling around the world after graduating from Garfield High School in 2014.  Jim Lane, 56, Doreen Richmond, 57, and Jeannie DeBari, 59: The three Whatcom County residents began a two-month trek along the Great Himalayan Trail in Nepal at the beginning of April. They were last seen April 22 between Mount Kanchenjunga and Mount Makalu, according to Richmond\u2019s sister. Lane, a retired Bellingham firefighter, and Richmond, a retired Bellingham schoolteacher, are a couple who live on Lummi Island; DeBari, a married mother of two grown children, is the former owner of Milano\u2019s Restaurant in Glacier, where she lives.Caption:  Greg A checkpost hut in Langtang National Park was damaged  when the earthquake hit. \u201cSome of us slept in here on the first night. All night long the aftershocks continued, with valley walls sliding regularly,\u201d said Seattle\u2019s  Greg Davenport.
