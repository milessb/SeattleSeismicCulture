A quake of 4.2 on the Richter scale, recorded at 9:58 last night, was centered about six miles west of Mount Rainier near the boundary of Mount Rainier National Park, said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University of Washington geophysics department. The second, centered in the same area, measured 3.9 at 10:59 p.m.         Earthquakes are common in that area, but these two were larger than usual, Jonientz-Trisler said. The two yesterday were caused by shallow earth movement, and were not located in the volcanic cone of Mount Rainier, she said.         About three dozen aftershocks, most too slight to feel, occurred later last night and today, she said.         The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. A reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.         An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in a local area, 4 can cause moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, and 6 can be severe. A 7 reading is a ``major'' quake, capable of widespread heavy damage, and 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.         The 1964 Alaska quake that killed 131 people measured 8.4 on the Richter scale, while the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 was estimated to register 8.3.", "edition": "Zone"}
