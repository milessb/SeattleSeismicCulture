Dan Fitzgerald, deputy director of Whatcom County emergency services, said no serious damage or injuries were reported.         University of Washington seismology laboratory scientists told him the quake was centered ``right under Deming and was very shallow so people there would tend to feel it more than usual.''         A series of small aftershocks followed the main shake, one about every 10 minutes for the next half hour, Fitzgerald said. ``The university people said they think those are just things settling down'' rather than a buildup to another quake.         Fitzgerald said Deming is an unincorporated farming community with several service stations, a small store and a school.         A tape recording at the UW seismology lab noted that the Deming area has experienced earthquakes previously. It sits at the base of Mount Baker, a volcano that at times puffs steam.         Cherrie Roberts, a clerk in the Deming Self Serve Store, said the quake shook numerous cans and jars of food off the shelves but with little breakage.         ``The liquor store next door had a lot stuff on the floor but only three of the bottles broke,'' Roberts said.", "edition": "Third"}
