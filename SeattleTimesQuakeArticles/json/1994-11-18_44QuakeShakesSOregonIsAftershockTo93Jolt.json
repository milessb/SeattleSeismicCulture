The 4.4-magnitude quake was recorded at 12:30 p.m. and was centered 20 miles northwest of Klamath Falls, according to the National Earthquake Information Center.    The quake was considered an aftershock to a magnitude-5.7 earthquake on Sept. 20, 1993, centered 15 miles northwest of Klamath Falls. That quake killed a driver in a rockslide, damaged buildings, and closed highways and a bridge.    The Klamath County sheriff's office received no calls of damage or injury, said records clerk Linda Wheelock.    \"It was nothing big, that's for sure,\" said Wheelock, who was riding in a car at the time and did not feel the quake.", "edition": "Final"}
