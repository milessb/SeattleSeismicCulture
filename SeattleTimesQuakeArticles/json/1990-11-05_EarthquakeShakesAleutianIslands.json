The quake measured 5.6 on the Richter scale, according to the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center. It struck at 1:05 p.m. Alaska Standard Time and was centered about 10 miles south of Amchitka Island, said Tom Sokolowski, chief of the Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer.        Amchitka is about 1,225 miles southwest of Anchorage, near the western end of the Aleutians, which stretch from Alaska toward the Soviet Union.        ``It was felt strongly on Amchitka, rattled clocks on walls, but there was no damage,'' Sokolowski said.", "edition": "Second"}
