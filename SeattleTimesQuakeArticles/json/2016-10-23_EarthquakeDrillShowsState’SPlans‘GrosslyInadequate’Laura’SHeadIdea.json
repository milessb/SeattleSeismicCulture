During the four-day \u201cCascadia Rising\u201d exercise in June, 23,000 participants grappled with a hypothetical catastrophe that knocked out power, roads and communications and left communities battered, isolated \u2014 and with no hope of quick relief.  Washington state officials called their own response plans \u201cgrossly inadequate,\u201d according to a draft report and records reviewed by The Seattle Times. The report warns that \u201cthe state is at risk of a humanitarian disaster within 10 days\u201d of the quake.  The government\u2019s ability to provide aid in the immediate aftermath of a catastrophic earthquake is so limited that Washington state\u2019s Emergency Management Division will now ask residents to stock enough resources to survive on their own for up to two weeks, instead of the three days it advised in the past.  The report also warned that Washington\u2019s own laws could actually prevent officials from marshaling medical resources to treat the legions of injured people.  The blunt assessment comes from a late-stage draft of Washington state\u2019s post-mortem on the exercise, which followed two years of planning and included officials from three states, the U.S. government and British Columbia. Washington\u2019s emergency-management division plans to brief the governor on the findings in January.  \u201cWe know this is an issue that will require strong coordination at every level of government,\u201d said Tara Lee, a spokeswoman for Gov. Jay Inslee.  Beyond the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the report says Washington lacks any long-term strategy to help the region\u2019s economy, cities and businesses recover from what would be one of the worst natural disasters the United States has ever faced.  \u201cEverything we depend on to live our 21st-century lives is going to be significantly degraded or eradicated,\u201d said Washington Emergency Management Director Robert Ezelle. \u201cThe needs are going to be immediate, they are going to be urgent and they are going to be overwhelming.\u201d  The \u201cCascadia Rising\u201d scenario, developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), estimates that a magnitude 9 quake and tsunami could kill 14,000 people and injure more than 30,000 in Washington and Oregon alone. More than 7,000 highway bridges and 16,000 miles of roadway are expected to suffer moderate to severe damage, including all routes to the Pacific Coast and Washington\u2019s major east-west corridors.  The severity of the destruction was not news to emergency managers, Ezelle said. But the drill succeeded in exposing gaps and weaknesses in plans that had never been tested on such a massive scale.  \u201cIt gave us perspective that we did not have,\u201d Ezelle said.  State, local and federal agencies are now finalizing their own \u201cafter-action\u201d reports that will identify what worked, what failed and how to apply the lessons learned.  A lack of resources is a recurring theme in those post-mortems. FEMA\u2019s report noted that emergency management operations across the Northwest suffer from staffing and budget shortages. In many jurisdictions, a single person is responsible for emergency planning.  \u201cIf this event happens, the first question everybody is going to ask is: \u2018How come you weren\u2019t ready?\u2019\u200a\u201d said Chuck Wallace, the manager and only full-time employee of Grays Harbor County\u2019s emergency department. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re working with pennies.\u201d  The state already has a plan to improve its resilience. Published in 2012, it calls for a series of steps to strengthen vulnerable buildings, ensure the safety of schools and harden critical infrastructure.  However, as the \u201cCascadia Rising\u201d report notes, the recommendations haven\u2019t been implemented.  \u201cWashington is not currently a resilient state,\u201d the report says.  The challenges posed by the simulated disaster were obvious from the first day. When Ezelle attempted to contact Gov. Inslee\u2019s office, his satellite phone didn\u2019t work and he had to get a second one to make the call.  Several participants had trouble getting satellite phones to operate as they attempted to simulate operations without regular phone or internet service. Ham radio operators helped fill the gap, along with military-communications units deployed by the National Guard.  One of the state\u2019s top priorities is to develop a robust emergency-communications system, though Ezelle said he\u2019s not sure what form it would take.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be able to talk and we\u2019ve got to be able to share data,\u201d he said.  The breakdown in communications illustrated a problem with current plans that require state and federal responders to wait for local communities to request assistance. That works well in smaller-scale emergencies, like floods and fires, but in the chaos and blackouts that follow a Cascadia megaquake and tsunami, those pleas may not get through, Ezelle said.  During the drill, Seattle emergency managers got little or no response to their requests for assistance, including for urban search-and-rescue teams, according to the city\u2019s analysis of the exercise.  A better approach is for the state to anticipate what communities will need and be prepared to push out supplies and personnel as soon as possible, Ezelle said.  The Washington National Guard is already working with local jurisdictions to anticipate their needs and let them know what types of resources are available, said Lt. Col. Clayton Braun, deputy joint operations officer at the Washington Military Department.  During the drill, participants simulated situations ranging from a sinkhole opening up in downtown Seattle, to coordinating rescues from collapsed buildings and allocating scarce fuel supplies.  Though the scenarios were hypothetical, tempers sometimes flared for real.  One of the biggest sources of tension noted in the report was over how quickly damaged roads and bridges could be reopened. There aren\u2019t enough helicopters in the region to supply all the communities that will need help, Ezelle said, so damaged roadways will need to be cleared as soon as possible.  \u201cIf you cannot get the transportation infrastructure up and running, you\u2019re not going to have a response,\u201d he said.  On one occasion, emergency managers told Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) officials that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d to take three days to clear a massive landslide from Interstate 90, according to records reviewed by The Times.  Transportation officials were frustrated when emergency officials were slow to identify priority routes for clearance. The result was an atmosphere one evaluator described as \u201cpoisonous.\u201d  Washington Military Department spokeswoman Karina Shagren said the friction \u201chighlights the stressful environment \u2014 which can exist in both real-world and exercise scenarios.\u201d  WSDOT is working on a plan to address gaps identified in the exercise and to better manage expectations of how long it will take to repair damage, WSDOT spokeswoman Barbara LaBoe said.  The exercise also showed that the state\u2019s traditional approach of relying on the Red Cross won\u2019t be adequate to handle the nearly 3 million people who could need food, water and shelter.  Hospitals will be overwhelmed with casualties, yet Washington\u2019s governor lacks the authority to grant some types of medical waivers, such as allowing doctors and nurses from other states and countries to help.  Lee, the governor\u2019s spokeswoman, said the issue \u201cis one of many that we are looking into following the exercise.\u201d  With no expectation of more funding in the near term, several emergency-management departments around the state hope to recruit and train more volunteers.  Seattle Emergency Management Director Barb Graff recently assigned one staff person to coordinate a corps of volunteers to assist with search and rescue, help run emergency shelters and perform other tasks.  The state Emergency Management Division is requesting $750,000 a year for a public-education campaign urging citizens to beef up their emergency kits for up to two weeks.  Clallam County emergency coordinator Penny Linterman goes even further. On the Olympic Peninsula, where communities are likely to be cut off due to road and bridge damage, she recommends people keep enough supplies on hand for three weeks to a month.  \u201cWhat you have on hand when this occurs is how you\u2019re going to survive,\u201d she said.  \u201cEverything we depend on to live our 21st-century lives is going to be significantly degraded or eradicated. The needs are going to be immediate, they are going to be urgent and they are going to be overwhelming.\u201d  Everything we depend on to live our 21st-century lives is going to be significantly degraded or eradicated. The needs are going to be immediate, they are going to be urgent and they are going to be overwhelming.\u201d  Robert Ezelle  Washington emergency management directorCaption:  Vehicles and Washington National Guard troops land at Jensen Point on Vashon Island during the \u201cCascadia Rising\u201d exercise in June.
