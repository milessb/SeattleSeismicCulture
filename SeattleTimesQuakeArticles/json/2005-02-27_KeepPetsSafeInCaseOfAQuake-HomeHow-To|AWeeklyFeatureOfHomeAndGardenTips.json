But you might not have thought about quake care for Fido and Fluffy. Here's a list of ways to assure your pets' safety before, during and after an earthquake:</EM> Before an earthquake: \u2022 Have a hard-sided carrier for each pet. \u2022 Keep a 72-hour supply of pet food and bottled water. \u2022 Create an emergency kit of first-aid items, medications, leash, doggie pick-up bags and cat litter. \u2022 Make sure each of your pets has a microchip ID and an ID tag on its collar. \u2022 Train your pet to come when called. \u2022 Have a current picture of each pet, in case he becomes lost. Keep copies of your pet's health records, too. During an earthquake: \u2022 Call your pet to your place of safety and place him in his carrier. \u2022 Do not try to hold your pet during the shaking. Animals will protect themselves instinctively and hide where they're safe. If you get in their way, even the nicest pet can turn on you. After an earthquake: \u2022 Do not let your pet loose outside. \u2022 Watch to see that your pet avoids contaminated water or items such as spilled antifreeze. And watch out for frayed or downed electrical lines. \u2022 Remember that if your home is not safe for you, it isn't safe for your pet, either. Emergency evacuation centers will not accept your pet, so you'll need to find somewhere safe for him. If your pet becomes lost: \u2022 Contact your local animal-control agency and file a lost-animal report. \u2022 Bring a photo of your pet to the agency and visit frequently to look for your pet. \u2022 Place notices throughout your neighborhood and area veterinary clinics.
