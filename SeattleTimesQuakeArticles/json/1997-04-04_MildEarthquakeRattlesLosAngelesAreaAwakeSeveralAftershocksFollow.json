There were no reports of injuries.    The quake happened at 1:26 a.m., and some residents reported feeling it for several minutes. There were several strong aftershocks.    \"The shaking was very violent in the bed, and I weigh 300 pounds and so it's not easy to shake me,\" said John Kenney, who lives in Beverly Hills. \"We live in a building that's very well built . . . and this thing rocked us pretty good.\"     The epicenter of the 3.3-magnitude earthquake was three miles northeast of Inglewood, said Nick Scheckel, a seismologist with the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.    Los Angeles-area police received numerous reports, but none involving injuries. Los Angeles firefighters fanned out in \"earthquake mode,\" searching the city for any problems.    An aftershock of 2.5-magnitude followed at 1:35 a.m., a couple of miles to the south of the first quake's epicenter.    \"Ordinarily we wouldn't expect aftershocks from this small an earthquake,\" said John Minsch, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center, in Golden, Colo.    An unrelated earthquake struck at 1:33 a.m. in rural Landers, 110 miles east of Los Angeles, Scheckel said.", "edition": "First"}
