The 5:55 a.m. temblor was felt from Bothell to Bellevue and across Lake Washington to the University Village and Sand Point areas.         Police in those areas reported dozens of telephone calls from people who had been awakened by the quake. But no injuries or damage were reported.         The quake was believed centered in the same Kirkland-Juanita area where a swarm of 10 small jolts struck early last Friday morning, said Dr. John Malone, a University of Washington seismologist. Malone said only three of those could be felt by humans.         He placed this morning's quake at a strength of 2.8 to 3 on the Richter scale of ground motion.         Low-level seismic activity has apparently been on the increase in the Kirkland-Juanita area the past few months. Jim Raney, a UW engineering technician in the seismology laboratory, attributes it to a fault that runs from Granite Falls to Tacoma, passing through the Kirkland-Juanita area.        An earthquake of magnitude 3.0 can cause slight damage.", "edition": "First"}
