Steve Hoyt, the district's capital-projects manager, said the bond issue would pay for seismic improvements in the roofs at Lynnwood and Edmonds-Woodway high schools, College Place and Oak Heights elementary schools, Lynnwood Intermediate School and Maplewood School.      The schools scheduled to be built or remodeled - a new high school, Meadowdale High and Seaview Elementary - also would be designed with structural improvements to help avoid earthquake damage, Hoyt said.     He said many of the district's schools were built when earthquake forces weren't well understood. But he added  that many of the district's buildings withstood the 1965 quake without significant damage.     All district schools built or modernized since 1987 also have structural improvements designed to help withstand earthquakes, he said.", "edition": "Final"}
