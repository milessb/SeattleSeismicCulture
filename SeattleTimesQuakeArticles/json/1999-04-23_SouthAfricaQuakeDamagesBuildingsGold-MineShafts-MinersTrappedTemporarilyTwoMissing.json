There were no reports of injuries, but two miners were missing.     The earthquake had a preliminary magnitude of 4.2.     The quake damaged one of the shafts at the Matjhabeng mine outside Welkom, and 400 miners made their way to other shafts where working elevators were bringing them to the surface, said Karl Schoemaker, a spokesman for AngloGold, which operates the mine.     Two miners at the shaft were still missing by late morning, he said.     About 600 workers at two other shafts were brought to the surface as emergency power was restored, he said.     The Matjhabeng lies in one of the oldest gold-mining areas of the country, about 155 miles southwest of Johannesburg at the bottom of an arc of gold-producing fields around Johannesburg.     Production should be back to normal by next week, Schoemaker said.     Minor tremors frequently cause rock slides or mudslides in mine shafts in South Africa, which has some of the world's deepest mines, said Greg Mcagshelwa, a spokesman for the National Union of Mineworkers.Caption:  MAPTHE SEATTLE TIMES: SOUTH AFRICA (MAP NOT AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY)", "edition": "Final"}
