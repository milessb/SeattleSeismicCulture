There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.        Agency officials said the quake had a preliminary reading of 6.6 on the Richter scale and had its epicenter on Soviet-occupied Kunashiri Island, northeast of Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido.        The quake's focus was about 74 miles beneath the epicenter.        A quake registering 6 on the Richter scale is capable of causing severe damage.        The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph.", "edition": "First"}
