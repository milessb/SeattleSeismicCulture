Lee", "text": "SIMI VALLEY, Calif. - A moderate earthquake that was followed by dozens of aftershocks jolted sleepers awake and toppled goods from store shelves yesterday.    The quake hit at 3:37 a.m. and measured 5.0, followed three minutes later by a 4.0-magnitude aftershock, said Steve Bryant, a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.    Other aftershocks struck throughout the morning, with the largest magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 3.8.    No injuries or serious damage were reported.    The quakes were centered within 13 miles of the epicenter of the 1994 Northridge quake, a 6.7-magnitude shocker that killed 72 people and caused $25 billion in damage.    \"It was shades of '94,\" said June Loeper, 76, of Granada Hills. Her home was extensively damaged in the Northridge earthquake.    Barbara Medina was working at a 7-Eleven convenience store in Simi Valley when she felt the first aftershock.    \"Everything just started shaking,\" she said. This month is earthquake-preparedness month in California and fire departments, fresh from a round of training, went into earthquake mode. They dispatched equipment and fire trucks to check areas for damage.    For unknown reasons, April traditionally is the month with the largest recorded number of earthquakes, said Pat Jorgenson, public-affairs director for the U.S Geological Survey in Menlo Park.", "edition": "Final"}
