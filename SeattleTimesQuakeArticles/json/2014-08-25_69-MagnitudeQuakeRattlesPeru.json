There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, said Mario Casareto, spokesman for Peru\u2019s fire agency. He said authorities were still surveying the region, including the Ayacucho area where the quake was centered.  The quake occurred Sunday shortly before 4:30 p.m. (PST) and was centered about 27 miles east-northeast of an area called Tambo, 290 miles southeast of the capital of Lima. It had a depth of 62.8 miles, the survey said.  Local media said that the quake was felt in Lima and in many major cities of southeastern Peru, including Cuzco and Arequipa.  Iceland says no sign of eruption  Iceland lowered its aviation alert level Sunday, saying there was no sign of an imminent eruption at the Bardarbunga volcano, as scientists at the Icelandic Meteorological Office said an announcement Saturday of an eruption was wrong.  A 2010 eruption of Iceland\u2019s Eyjafjallajokul volcano caused international aviation chaos, with more than 100,000 flights canceled.", "edition": "Unknown"}
