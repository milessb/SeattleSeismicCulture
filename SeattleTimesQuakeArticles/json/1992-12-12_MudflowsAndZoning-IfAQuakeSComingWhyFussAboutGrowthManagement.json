Now, let me get this straight. First, we have to worry about giant mudflows from Mount Rainier destroying the Orting Valley; so therefore, we must stop all growth from happening there (per the state's Growth Management Act).     Now, we have to worry about a huge magnitude earthquake destroying metropolitan Seattle. Gee, I guess we had better move the population of Seattle out of the immediate urban area and concentrate on saving lives by setting people farther out beyond the suburbs.     Whoops, this sounds contrary to the Growth Management Act's mandate of clogging up the cities and keeping the rural areas pristine in perpetuity.     Gosh, all you planners out there - I guess you can't have it both ways! Maybe we need to go back to the drawing board and let people live where they want to live (within proper zoning) and forget all this growth management nonsense. It now seems that too many lives may be at stake! - Judi Moody, Sumne", "edition": "Final"}
