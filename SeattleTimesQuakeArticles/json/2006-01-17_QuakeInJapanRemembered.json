Karin Zaugg Black, president of the Seattle-Kobe Sister City Association, Japanese Consul General Kazuo Tanaka and other dignitaries joined in a moment of silence at the exact time of the earthquake, 12:46 p.m., before taking turns ringing the bell. The magnitude 7.2 quake and subsequent fires killed more than 6,400 people. Kobe and Seattle have been sister cities since 1962, Zaugg Black said. After the quake, Seattle residents went to the Kobe Bell at Seattle Center to ring it and pray for the victims, a ritual repeated each year since. On Monday, candles placed in three special bamboo candleholders from Kobe were lit. Each holder is imprinted with Japanese script, which when read in proper order expresses the condolence, \"A prayer to mourn a bond.\"Caption:  photoJohn Lok / The Seattle Times : At exactly 12:46 p.m., Michihiro Yuasa, center, joins 44 others at the Kobe Bell at Seattle Center on Monday to commemorate the 11th anniversary of the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake in Kobe, Japan.
