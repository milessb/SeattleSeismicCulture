Preliminary measurements indicated yesterday's quake measured 5.5 on the Richter scale. It occurred at about 9 p.m. and was centered 90 miles southwest of Haines and 110 miles west of Juneau, said Bob Hammond with the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer.     The epicenter was about 20 miles underground, Hammond said.     He said the quake was widely felt across southeastern Alaska but probably was not strong enough to have caused significant damage or injuries.     A weaker aftershock centered near Sitka was recorded about 15 minutes later, Hammond said.     The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 6.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 5.5.     The 1964 Alaska quake that killed 131 people measured 8.4 on the Richter scale.", "edition": "Final"}
