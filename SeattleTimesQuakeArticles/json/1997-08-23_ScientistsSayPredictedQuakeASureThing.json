So what is the possibility that a major earthquake will strike the Israeli town of Megiddo, the biblical site for Armageddon?     It's not just possible - \"it's certain,\" said geophysicist Amos Nur in an interview. \"We just don't know when.\"     In an article in the July-August issue of Biblical Archaeology Review, Nur, a geophysics professor at Stanford University in California, and Hagai Ron, of the Geophysical Institute of Israel, trace the history of earthquakes in and around Megiddo.    They contend that some destruction of the site commonly attributed to Israelite invaders might have been caused by earthquakes.    Described as an unprecedented event, the language used in Revelation referring to the earthquake might seem a bit sensational. But that is largely how people thought of earthquakes in ancient times - before scientific records and methods provided historical context.    \"People who experienced them were convinced they never happened before or would never happen again,\" said Nur.", "edition": "Final"}
