Seismic monitoring equipment, which measures shock waves from earthquakes, is considered the best method of detecting nuclear tests, and would be essential to verifying compliance with any bilateral agreement limiting the number or size of nuclear blasts.        Four seismic listening posts were established without publicity at widely scattered Soviet sites last year, and the two governments agreed last month to install better equipment there and at two additional sites by next spring, U.S. officials and independent scientists say.        In return, the Soviet Union is to get seismic data from U.S. equipment at five sites in the United States and has approval to set up its own seismic listening posts in Blacksburg, Va., 257 miles southwest of Washington, and in Albuquerque, N.M., about 200 miles east of the U.S. underground nuclear test site in Nevada.        Under the arrangement, Soviet scientists staff the U.S. posts on Soviet territory, using equipment owned by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).        The program would put both countries ``in a better position to assess the effectiveness of seismic data in monitoring nuclear tests,'' said Jonathan Berger, a geophysicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., who helped negotiate the arrangement and secured Pentagon funding on behalf of a consortium of more than 60 universities and colleges.        DARPA spokeswoman Jan Bodanyi declined to provide any information about the program.", "edition": "Final"}
