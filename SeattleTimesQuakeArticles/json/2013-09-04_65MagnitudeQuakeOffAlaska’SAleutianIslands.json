The Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said there was no danger of a tsunami from the Tuesday afternoon quake.  The quake was centered about 50 miles south-southwest of the tiny community of Atka, at a depth of about 24 miles, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. Earthquakes, even large ones, are very common in the area, scientists say.  Dozens of aftershocks have occurred since Friday\u2019s big quake.  There have been no reports of damage or injuries.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the quakes in pretty much the same area,\u201d said Rafael Abreu, a geophysicist with the USGS\u2019 National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. \u201cI could definitely consider it an aftershock.\u201d  Several hours after Tuesday\u2019s quake, Abreu said the USGS\u2019 earthquake website had received no reports from anyone who felt it.  Last Friday\u2019s 7.0 quake was felt in Atka, an Aleut community of 64 people, and the larger Aleutian town of Adak, where 320 people live.  Abreu said the Alaska quake was not connected to several large earthquakes recorded Tuesday off British Columbia, Canada.  The largest of those quakes was a magnitude 6.0 and was centered nearly 120 miles off Bella Bella on British Columbia\u2019s northern coast. Several aftershocks were recorded, including one measuring magnitude 5.9.  Those quakes did not generate a tsunami, and there have been no damage reports.  The area off British Columbia is also a common site for earthquakes, Abreu said.", "edition": "Unknown"}
