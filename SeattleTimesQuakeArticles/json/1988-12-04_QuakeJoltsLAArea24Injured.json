The earth shook across 15,000 square miles and seven counties for about 15 seconds.         An earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage in the local area, 6 severe damage and 7 heavy damage.         It was the strongest quake in the Los Angeles area since a 5.9 temblor on Oct. 1, 1987, and an aftershock two days later killed eight people, injured 200 and caused $358 million in damage.Caption:  PHOTO", "edition": "Sunday"}
