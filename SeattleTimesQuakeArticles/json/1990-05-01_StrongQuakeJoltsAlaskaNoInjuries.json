The quake measured 6.4 on the Richter scale and struck at 8:15 a.m., according to the Alaska Tsunami Center. It was centered about 10 miles south of King Salmon, a village of 530 people about 280 miles southwest of Anchorage.        The center said there was no danger of a tsunami, or tidal wave that can be generated by quakes.        Alaska state police said there were no damage reports.        The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.", "edition": "Final"}
