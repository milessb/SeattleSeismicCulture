A study of sediment layers off Oregon and Washington suggests that the average interval between great earthquakes in the Cascadia Subduction Zone is 585 years.    Dieter Weichert and John Adams of the Geological Survey of Canada presented their findings yesterday at the annual meeting of the Seismological Society of America in El Paso.    Scientists think the last earthquake of magnitude 8 or more to occur in the Pacific Northwest happened in 1700. The Cascadia Subduction Zone is where the Juan de Fuca Plate plunges beneath the North American Plate", "edition": "Final"}
