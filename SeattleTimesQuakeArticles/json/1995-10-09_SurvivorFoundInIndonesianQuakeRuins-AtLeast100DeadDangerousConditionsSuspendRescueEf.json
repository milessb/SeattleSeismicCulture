All he could do was pray.    Yesterday, his prayers were answered. \"Allah has spared me,\" said Bachtiar, 37, after soldiers lifted him from the ruins of his house. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.    Bachtiar's thigh was smashed, dried blood caked his head and he was almost too weak to speak.    But he was alive, the first survivor found in the rubble since an earthquake early Saturday tore through this remote valley on Indonesia's Sumatra Island, killing more than 100 people and seriously injuring nearly 700.    He said he was pinned by a roof beam as his wife and four children escaped from their collapsing brick-and-wood house.    Despite their elation at finding a survivor, soldiers had to suspend their search because of a torrential downpour.    Officials, who said more than 100 people were killed in the quake, had found 80 bodies. They draped them in white shrouds, carted them to the edge of town and buried them in mass graves to prevent the spread of disease.Caption:  PHOTOMUCHTAR ZAKARIA / AP: SURVIVORS OF A DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE PREPARE FOOD NEAR A COLLAPSED HOUSE IN SUNGAIPENUH, CENTRAL SUMATRA.
