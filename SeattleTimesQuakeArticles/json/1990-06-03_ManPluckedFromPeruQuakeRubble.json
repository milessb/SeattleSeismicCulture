Thanks to God I'm still alive. . . . I was only waiting to die under the rubble,'' Miguel Carrizos Reyna mumbled as he was rescued from the rubble in the village of Segunda Jerusalen in the Amazon jungle area, the reports said.        Journalists and villagers dug out Carrizos with their bare hands after hearing moaning in the rubble.        About 200 people are believed to have been killed by the 48-second quake that struck northern Peru last Tuesday.", "edition": "Final"}
