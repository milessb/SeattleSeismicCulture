However, the U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was probably not powerful enough to create a deadly tsunami. \"This earthquake isn't big enough,\" said geophysicist Randy Baldwin. \"Generally it needs to be over 7.2 [magnitude].\" Officials at Indonesia's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency said a tsunami alert had been issued. Smaller waves were recorded farther down the coast.", "edition": "Fourth"}
