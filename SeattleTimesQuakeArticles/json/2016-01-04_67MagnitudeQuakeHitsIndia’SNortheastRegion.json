The quake was also felt in Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar, also known as Burma.  The death and injuries were caused by falling debris in and around Imphal, the capital of Manipur state, police said.  The powerful tremor left large cracks in walls and a portion of a popular market building collapsed in the state capital.  A newly constructed six-story building also collapsed in Imphal, the police control room said.  India\u2019s Meteorological Department said the epicenter of the quake was in Tamenglong region of Manipur state. It struck before dawn at a depth of about 10 miles in the India-Myanmar border region.  The epicenter of the earthquake was 20 miles northwest of Imphal. The area is remote with poor cellphone and Internet connections, and information about conditions outside major cities may take time to emerge.  People panicked and rushed out of their homes in Gauhati, the capital of neighboring Assam state, as they felt massive shaking at least twice within 60 seconds.  In Imphal, residents said furniture was knocked over and books fell off shelves.  \u201cThe ground swayed for almost a minute, jolting people awake in their homes,\u201d said one resident, Apem Arthur.  The area is dotted with small houses. There are few tall buildings in the region, she said.  The tremors were also felt in Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal state.  The seismically active region was hit by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake in   Nepal in April that left more than 20,000 people dead or injured.  In 2005, a 7.6 magnitude earthquake killed at least 86,000 people in Pakistan.Caption:  A man comforts his injured wife Monday as she waits for treatment at a hospital after a 6.7 magnitude earthquake in India\u2019s remote northeast region.
