The quake, measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale, hit yesterday morning about 500 miles north of Cape Adare in Victorialand in Antarctica, a Washington-based Geological Survey spokesman said. It was the strongest earthquake in the area since a 7.2 quake hit June 11, 1970, he said.        The magnitude of Thursday's quake was not great enough to generate a Pacific-wide tsunami, or tidal wave, according to the Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu.", "edition": "Third"}
