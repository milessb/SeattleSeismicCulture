The destruction from Saturday's earthquake in Hebei province, north of Beijing, was worse than initially reported. Although the casualty count held steady - 50 dead, 11,440 people injured, 1,200 of them seriously - estimates of damage to homes soared as rescue workers reached more communities in the hilly, remote region.    Relief officials in Hebei reported that the 6.2 magnitude quake flattened 103,000 houses, and a provincial spokesman said another 130,000 houses were uninhabitable.  The state-run Xinhua News Agency said 542,000 people had been injured or left homeless.    State television showed people sleeping on straw under thick quilts in large canvas tents with campfires burning outside as nighttime temperatures dropped to below freezing.    Doctors were struggling, without adequate medicine or medical facilities, to treat the injured, Xinhua said. Many suffered broken limbs or were burned or scalded by fires caused by the quake.    More food also was needed, the news agency said.    Convoys of trucks, vans and buses rushed winter overcoats, quilts and tents to the region. Xinhua said 121 organizations - mainly government offices and the military - had sent aid to Zhangbei County, the hardest-hit area.Caption:  PHOTOYUAN MAN / XINHUA NEWS AGENCY: LI DENGJIA LOOKS FOR POSSESSIONS IN THE RUINS OF HIS HOUSE, WHICH WAS DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE IN NORTHERN CHINA SATURDAY.", "edition": "Final"}
