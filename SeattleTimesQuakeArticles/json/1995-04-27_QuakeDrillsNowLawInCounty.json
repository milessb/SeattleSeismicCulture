The exercise will assess any changes to the county's disaster response made after yesterday's \"Sound Shake '95\" drills.     The ordinance calls for:      --  A long-range plan to ensure that county government can continue to operate and provide services during a major disaster.     --  A regionwide command structure to clarify who is in charge.     --  A countywide disaster training and education plan, including at least three emergency-preparedness seminars each school year for teachers and school administrators.     --  Support for the Red Cross' distribution of emergency-shelter supplies to local facilities, including schools.     --  A new earthquake and disaster guidebook for citizens and county employees.      In Bellevue, officials are working on recovery plans after yesterday's drill - a simulated quake that registered 8 on the Richter.     From an emergency-operations center in Crossroads, representatives of all Bellevue city departments coordinated responses to reports of simulated damage and casualties, which included severe damage to several schools, a large hardware store, and the Meydenbauer reservoir.     Initial indications are that although city officials communicated well, communications should be accelerated", "edition": "Final"}
