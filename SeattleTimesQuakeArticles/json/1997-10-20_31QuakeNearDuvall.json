The quake occurred at 4:06 p.m. and was centered about five miles northeast of Duvall, said Bill Steele, coordinator of the UW Seismology Laboratory.    About 10 people called the lab to say they felt the quake.    \"A person on Mountain View Road said it shook her house for about four seconds,\" Steele said.    There were no reports of injuries.    The quake occurred in the same area where a 5.3 magnitude quake struck May 2, 1996, Steele said.     Former City Councilwoman Kass Holdeman was at home quilting when she felt the ground move.     \"I felt it through the floor. It just shook for three seconds,\" Holdeman said. \"It was like a big truck driving by.\"      It was just a vibration, Holdeman said, and nothing compared to last year's quake, which she described as a \"jolt.\" Seattle Times Eastside reporter Putsata Reang contributed to this report.Caption:  PUTSATA REANG", "edition": "Final"}
