The supports at both ends have been crumbling where water drippings have eaten away the concrete. On Feb. 28, 2001, the Nisqually earthquake sent a crack across a 5-foot-wide girder. The city will erect a new bridge, using $2.5 million in federal money plus $1.1 million from city coffers. Preliminary work starts at 7 a.m. Monday, when a nine-month shutdown of Meydenbauer Beach Park will begin. The bridge will be closed from April 15 until mid-December, forcing 6,900 vehicles a day onto other roads. \"This is kind of the back door to Bellevue,\" Dan Millard, a city construction manager, said yesterday as he walked under the bridge. Not only does it connect Main Street to the exclusive shores of Lake Washington, but it also allows drivers to take shortcuts to Bellevue through Medina and Clyde Hill from Highway 520. East-west traffic across the bridge, on Northeast Lake Washington Boulevard, will be detoured to Northeast Eighth Street. During the seven- to 10-day demolition in late April, the half-century-old bridge will be broken by a machine called a hydraulic excavator. \"It's like a big jaw that bites into the concrete,\" transportation spokeswoman Barbara Ramey said. The new bridge will not only be more quake-resistant but wider to accommodate bike lanes and 7-foot sidewalks.
