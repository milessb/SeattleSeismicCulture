Scientists at the University of Washington Seismology Lab measured the 10:35 a.m. quake at 3.4 on the Richter scale.    Initial data showed the epicenter to be about five miles north of Monroe, said UW seismologist Chris Jonientz-Trisler.        Quakes of that size hit the Puget Sound region every two or three months, she said.", "edition": "Final"}
