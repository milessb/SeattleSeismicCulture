The total: $250 million. King County officials said they would ask for $176 million in aid for earthquake damage to local-government facilities from last week's quake. Under the Federal Emergency Management Agency's rules, counties affected by the earthquake were required to submit initial damage estimates to the state yesterday. The state will package those estimates and submit them to FEMA, which will determine final damage estimates in consultation with local officials. Those final estimates will be the basis for federal aid. Yesterday was also the deadline for the state to submit estimates of damage to its own facilities. The most expensive bill for the state is $30 million for Western State Hospital. That would pay for repairs to the psychiatric hospital and for overtime for staff members who guarded high-risk patients who were temporarily housed in the gymnasium. The University of Washington is asking for $28.7 million, which includes asbestos removal made necessary by quake damage, said Ed Penhale, a spokesman for the state Office of Financial Management. Penhale stressed that the figures were preliminary and could change before FEMA makes a payment to the state. The total includes $100 million for state-owned roads that Gov. Gary Locke  announced last week. Of $70.2 million in estimated damage to buildings on and near the Capitol campus in Olympia, $19.95 million is for the damaged legislative building. Even more expensive will be repairs to Deschutes Parkway, a state-owned road that circles Capitol Lake. In King County, the Port of Seattle sustained the most damage, $71 million. Damage to the seaport actually topped much-publicized damage to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, $39 million to $32 million. The waterfront suffered \"widespread minor damage,\" said Port spokesman Doug Williams, including settling and slumping of pavement and separation of some aprons from piers. \"Nothing collapsed in a giant heap,\" he said. \"It's a real boring $39 million.\" Damage to county-owned facilities totals $40 million, including $23 million at Boeing Field. Buildings owned by the city of Seattle sustained about $39 million damage. Damage to school-district buildings added up to $11.5 million, $10.3 million of that in the Highline School District. Among cities, Burien reported $3 million in quake damage, Renton $1.75 million, Bellevue $1.4 million and Snoqualmie $1 million. Water and sewer districts sustained an estimated $1.3 million in damage and fire districts $96,000. To try to get some money right away to those hardest hit by the quake, the state House last night overwhelmingly passed a bill that would create an emergency fund that would give grants of up to $14,400. Senate leaders said they hoped to vote on the bill today. The bill would take $1 million from the state emergency fund to start the Nisqually Earthquake account. That would be joined by $3 million from the federal government. FEMA estimates that the average grant to families will be between $3,000 and $4,000, though the maximum is $14,400. The $4 million fund would be available immediately while other money from FEMA could take longer. Also in the bill is $1 million from the emergency reserve fund to help pay power bills for low- income people hard hit by this winter's energy shortage. The emergency fund has $533 million.", "edition": "Fourth"}
