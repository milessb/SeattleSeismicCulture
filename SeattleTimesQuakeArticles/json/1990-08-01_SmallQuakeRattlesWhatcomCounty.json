Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the school's seismology laboratory said the temblor registered 3.5 on the Richter scale and was centered 1 1/2 miles east of Deming in an active seismic area about 90 miles north of Seattle.        As many as several thousand quakes have occurred in the area this year, all but a handful too weak to detect, she said.           An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in a local area; 4 can cause moderate damage and 5 considerable damage.", "edition": "Final"}
