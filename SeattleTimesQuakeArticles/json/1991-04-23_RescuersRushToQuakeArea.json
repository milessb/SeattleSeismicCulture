Officials said at least 74 people were killed, 830 injured and thousands left homeless     Yesterday's quake, which registered 7.4 on the Richter scale, was felt throughout Costa Rica and parts of Panama.     The worst damage was in Puerto Limon, Costa Rica's main Caribbean port with 130,000 people, where the three-story International Hotel, the Customs House, an office building and dozens of houses collapsed.     Most of Puerto Limon's residents wandered in the streets all night, afraid to return to their houses, officials said. More than 300 aftershocks were felt, said Milton Chaverri of the National Emergency Commission.     \"This place looks like one of these Hollywood apocalyptic movies. It felt like the world was coming to an end as everything moved and heaved,\" said Rigoberto Perez, a resident of Puerto Limon.     A gasoline tank at a government-owned oil refinery on the outskirts of the port exploded, sending up a huge fireball, and an electrical short circuit set a factory ablaze.Caption:  MAPAP: EARTHQUAKE IN COSTA RICA (MAP NOT IN ELECTRONIC VERSION)", "edition": "Final"}
