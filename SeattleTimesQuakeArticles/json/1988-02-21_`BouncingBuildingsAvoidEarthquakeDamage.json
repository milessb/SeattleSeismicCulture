The bouncing buildings are mounted on ``isolators'' _ cylindrical devices made of laminated rubber and hard steel plates _ and dampers so that the structure is not directly touching the ground, the engineers said.         The base-isolators slow the side-to-side heaving motion which is responsible for most earthquake damage, they said.         Two construction firms, the Ohbayashi Corp. and the Takenaka Komuten Co., said that data collected from buildings near Tokyo showed the isolators slowed the quakes' destructive shaking motion by 60 to 75 percent.         The method is most effective for buildings shorter than 15 stories. Skyscrapers these days are built so they are flexible, to absorb earthquake forces.", "edition": "Weekend"}
