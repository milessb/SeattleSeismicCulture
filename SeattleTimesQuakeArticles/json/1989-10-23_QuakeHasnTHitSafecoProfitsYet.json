In releasing its results, the major insurer said its damages from the California earthquake will be limited substantially if they rise past $10 million         The financial effect of the massive quake, which wracked the Bay Area last week, won't begin to affect profits until fourth-quarter results are known after the first of the year. But Safeco said beyond $10 million, its catastrophe-reinsurance coverage pays 60 percent of the next $10 million and 95 percent beyond $20 million.         In the third quarter, Safeco profits were $81.6 million, or $1.29 a share, on sales of $757 million vs. year-ago profits of $51.3 million, or 79 cents a share, on sales of $693 million. The underwriting loss was $6.8 million, the lowest quarterly figure of the year made more remarkable because it included $6.2 million in estimated claims from Hurricane Hugo.         The underwriting loss was offset by $67.7 million in profits - vs. $56 million in the year-ago quarter - from investment income.", "edition": "Final"}
