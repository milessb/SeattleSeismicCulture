There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, said Alec Medbery, a spokesman for the center.        The quake, with a preliminary reading of 5.5 on the Richter scale, was centered about 50 miles east of Adak, or some 1,200 miles southwest of Anchorage.        The quake occurred at 6:58 a.m., and was felt strongly in Adak and Atka.        Moderate to strong earthquakes are commonplace throughout Alaska.        The 1964 Good Friday earthquake, centered in Prince William Sound, measured 8.5 on the Richter scale. It generated large waves that devastated several coastal communities and killed 114 people as far south as Oregon and Hawaii.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. A reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.        An earthquake of 6 on Richter scale can cause severe damage in populated areas.", "edition": "Final"}
