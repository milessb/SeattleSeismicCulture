An official reached at the State Seismological Bureau who refused to give his name said 12 people were killed. He said it was not clear how many were injured. \"The earthquake this morning was quite scary,\" said a shopkeeper in Ruichang reached by telephone who would give only her surname, Zhou. She said a few one- and two-story buildings collapsed and many taller ones showed cracks in their facades. Many people in Ruichang were staying outside for fear of aftershocks. She said she felt a milder trembling of the earth around 1 p.m. The United States National Earthquake Information Center reported the quake was magnitude 5.5.", "edition": "Fourth"}
