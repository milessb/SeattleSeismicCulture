A nuclear exchange of only a fraction of the 50,000 warheads in existence would make the recent earthquake seem like a Sunday school picnic. If there is any silver lining in this cloud of tragedy, it should be to make all governments realize the futility of the current balance-of-terror mentality that insists on nuclear-weapon parity. No political goal is wor th subjecting the Earth to potential suicide; no amount of preparation could enable any country to cope with a nuclear disaster many times worse than the earthquake in Armenia    - Edward C.
