Fire crews red-tagged 20 apartment units in a building in the Orange County city of Fullerton after finding a major foundation crack. Structural woes, including broken and leaning chimneys, were uncovered in half a dozen single-family houses, which were also deemed unsafe to occupy until inspectors clear the structures. The damage displaced 83 residents.  Despite the evacuations and scattered damage, Friday night\u2019s magnitude-5.1 earthquake centered about 25 miles south of downtown Los Angeles mostly frayed nerves.  The quake was preceded by two smaller foreshocks. More than 100 aftershocks followed, including a magnitude-4.4 that hit Saturday afternoon, the largest in the sequence that was felt over a wide region. No injuries were reported.  Residents were inconvenienced and some lost valuables, but \u201cthankfully the damage wasn\u2019t greater,\u201d said Chi-Chung Keung, a Fullerton spokesman.  Business owners in Orange County spent the aftermath sweeping up shattered glass and restocking shelves. Utility crews worked to restore power and shut off gas leaks and fix water-main breaks. A rock slide in the Carbon Canyon area of nearby Brea also caused a car to overturn. The occupants had minor injuries, and the road remained closed to traffic.  The Red Cross opened a shelter in La Habra but closed it once the 38 people who stayed overnight returned home.  \u201cEverything is starting to get settled down here,\u201d La Habra police Sgt. Mel Ruiz said.  In Fullerton, some residents will have to stay elsewhere until building inspectors can check out the red-tagged apartments and houses and give an all-clear, Fire Battalion Chief John Stokes said.  Friday\u2019s jolt was the strongest to strike the greater Los Angeles region since 2008.Caption:  A woman walks her dog past a broken block wall in Fullerton, Calif., on Saturday, after a magnitude-5.1 quake hit overnight.
