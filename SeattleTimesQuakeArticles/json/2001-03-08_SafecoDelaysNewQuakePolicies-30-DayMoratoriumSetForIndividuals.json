The Seattle insurer said the move matches a moratorium already in effect for Safeco's commercial customers and brings it in line with other companies that already have 30-day moratoriums in place. \"We believe this is a sensible and responsible business decision in line with peer companies in our marketplace,\" said Claudette Kenmir, regional manager of personal insurance at Safeco. Safeco is the No. 1 personal-lines insurer in Washington state and the No. 2 quake insurer in the state behind State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance. Le Roi Brashears, a Safeco spokesman, said the insurer isn't planning to release information on its exposure from the Pacific Northwest quake, or the number of claims, until it has a better sense of the ultimate numbers. Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute, said such moratorium extensions are routine for insurers because it isn't good business to be writing new policies at a time when aftershocks could cause more damage.", "edition": "Fourth"}
