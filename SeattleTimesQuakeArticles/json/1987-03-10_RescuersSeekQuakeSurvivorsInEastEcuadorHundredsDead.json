Provincial officials said hundreds of people had been killed and thousands left homeless.        The earthquakes also snapped Ecuador's most important oil pipeline, forcing the government to indefinitely cut off oil exports, the source of more than 60 percent of the country's export earnings in recent years.        At least two powerful earthquakes and several smaller ones jolted eastern Ecuador Thursday night and Friday. They were followed by mudslides that crashed through bridges, buried roads and devastated many villages in the Amazon basin east of the spine-like mountain range running the length of the country.        ``There are hundreds of dead,'' Jorge Gonzalez, a senior administrator in Napo province, said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.Caption:  PHOTOUPI / REUTERS: THE OWNER OF A HOUSE DAMAGED IN ECUADOR'S EARTHQUAKE SURVEYS WHAT REMAINS.", "edition": "Third"}
