Officials at the Pacific Geoscience Center in Victoria, B.C., said the quake was centered in Howe Sound near Gambier Island, about 19 1/2 miles northwest of Vancouver. Tremors were felt as far north as Whistler and Blackcomb, as far south as Richmond and on some parts of Vancouver island.        The center said the first tremor was followed by five small aftershocks measuring less than 2 on the Richter scale.        There were no reports of damage or injuries.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake of 3.5 on the scale can cause slight damage.", "edition": "First"}
