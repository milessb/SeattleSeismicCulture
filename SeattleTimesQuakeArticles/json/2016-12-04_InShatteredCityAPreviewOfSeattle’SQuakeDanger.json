The youngest was 14, the oldest 78. At 12:51 p.m. on Feb. 22, 2011, most of them had seconds to live. The bus passed a cluster of old, brick buildings downtown, a place with the grit and throwback charm of Seattle\u2019s Pioneer Square. Below the soil was a crack in the bedrock, similar to the one under Seattle, where pressure that had built for centuries finally burst the city\u2019s foundation.  The earthquake shredded buildings and weaponized fragments of brick and concrete, crushing scores of people eating lunch, shopping and talking on the phone. The facade of one old, brick building, home to a noodle shop, separated from its walls and broke over Red Bus No. 702.  Almost six years later, Christchurch\u2019s ruined cityscape warns of the danger a few miles below Seattle, where pressure is building to inevitable violence along a fault extending from the foothills of the Cascades to Hood Canal. The similarities to Christchurch give Seattle officials a rare insight into what the city can expect to face.  New Zealand\u2019s second-largest city and Seattle were settled in the 1850s, constructed of similar materials under similar building codes. Each city also is situated above a fault that is relatively close to the surface, exposing them to a blast of seismic energy far more intense than deeper faults. An earthquake on Seattle\u2019s shallow fault could cause more damage to the city than the so-called Big One, a magnitude 9.0 rupture of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, seismic experts say.  Seattle\u2019s officials have two advantages that their counterparts in Christchurch lacked: They\u2019ve known about the fault for more than 20 years, and they can draw on New Zealand\u2019s experience for ways to blunt the damage and bounce back from it.  New Zealand had learned from its previous earthquakes. The country created a fund in 1945 to cover earthquake damage to insured homes, amassing $5.9 billion by 2010. The Ministry of Education had set higher structural standards for schools by the late 1990s, so when the Christchurch quake struck during school hours, there were no deaths on campuses. And after the tremors turned Christchurch\u2019s historic district into rubble, the Parliament amended the national building law earlier this year to require upgrades to the most at-risk buildings.  For the most part, Washington state has not adopted such measures. Seattle has yet to implement a policy to strengthen its most vulnerable buildings despite decades of discussion. While Seattle Public Schools has spent millions retrofitting schools, poorer districts have struggled to raise the necessary funds. Washington state doesn\u2019t require insurers to offer earthquake coverage, as California does, and the federal government doesn\u2019t underwrite it.  The odds of a shallow fault rupturing somewhere in the Puget Sound region over the next 50 years are greater than 1 in 7, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. That\u2019s three times more likely than picking a winning Powerball number.  Joan Gomberg, a Seattle-based geophysicist at the USGS, toured Christchurch after the February 2011 earthquake. The devastation \u201creally drove home in spades what can happen if an earthquake like that happens under a modern urban environment,\u201d she said.  Ann Brower, 40, was reading a magazine on Red Bus No. 702 when it heaved upward and crashed back down to the street.  Brower, a North Carolina native, had come to Christchurch on a Fulbright scholarship in 2004 and stayed, enchanted by its seaside villages and rugged mountains rising up from the Pacific Ocean. She taught environmental policy at a local university and was en route to a meeting that Tuesday. Instead, she fought for her life.  The collapsed roof of the bus landed on Brower\u2019s left hip, pressing down until her pelvis snapped. Bone protruded from her left leg and she fainted from the pain. When she came to, she could see little beyond the gray roof that crumpled around her. She began screaming.  The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.3 \u2014 much smaller, in energy released, than the magnitude 7.8 quake that struck more than 50 miles north of Christchurch in November 2016 and caused two deaths. It was also smaller than the magnitude 6.8 Nisqually earthquake that shook the Puget Sound region in 2001. But while the Nisqually quake was centered 30 miles underground, this oneruptured just 3 miles below Christchurch.  The February 2011 earthquake flung people to the ground as they tried to run. It snapped off the spire of the city\u2019s namesake cathedral, damaging a landmark as emblematic of Christchurch as the Space Needle is of Seattle. A government commission would later catalog where and how all 185 victims of the earthquake had died.  Two large buildings \u2014 the Canterbury Television and the Pyne Gould structures \u2014 collapsed, accounting for  115 and 18 deaths, respectively.  A falling slab of concrete killed a 27-year-old American woman rushing out of a tattoo parlor. A block away, a Canadian nurse shopping for souvenirs died in the rubble. A storefront collapsed onto a New Zealand woman carrying her 5-week-old daughter, killing them as they walked just yards behind the infant\u2019s father.  Eight people on Red Bus No. 702 died: the driver; a 41-year-old man heading to an economics lecture; a butcher on his way to meet his young daughters for lunch; an elderly couple on vacation; another couple going to a doctor\u2019s appointment; a 14-year-old boy whose school had let out early.  People nearby heard Ann Brower\u2019s screams from within the buried bus. They ripped off the roof with their bare hands, freed her leg from the seat crushing her and flagged down an SUV to get her to a hospital. She was the only survivor.  Lara Simmons, a structural engineer in Seattle, wasn\u2019t prepared for what she found when she moved to Christchurch six months after the February 2011 earthquake.  It wasn\u2019t the city\u2019s wrecked core \u2014 she expected that. It was the public depression that had set in.  \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like that friend of yours whose parent is going through a terminal illness and there\u2019s a cloud that\u2019s always over them. It\u2019s like the whole city had that cloud,\u201d she said.  Christchurch had weathered a major earthquake only months earlier, in September 2010, that caused billions of dollars in losses but no deaths. In February, residents who thought they\u2019d endured the worst learned their ordeal had just begun.  The 2011 earthquake shattered water and sewer lines. Some residents spent months without a flushing toilet. People dug latrines in their yards or collected their waste in lidded buckets, according to Andrea Cummings, who distributed buckets and chronicled her efforts in a self-published memoir, \u201cWould You Like a Toilet With That?\u201d  Cummings and her husband had a lawnmower business before the earthquake, but they gave up on it. \u201cNobody had lawns anymore,\u201d she said.  The government razed entire neighborhoods where it determined rebuilding would be too expensive \u2014 an area that would cover much of Seattle\u2019s core, from Elliott Bay over to Broadway, from Mercer Street down to South Jackson Street. The earthquakes of 2010 and 2011 damaged almost 170,000 homes, or three-quarters of the region\u2019s housing stock.  Officials approved the demolition of eight of every 10 buildings downtown. The military cordoned off portions of the city\u2019s business district for two years, displacing a quarter of the local workforce. The shortage of undamaged buildings sent home and rental prices soaring far above national rates.  Simmons stayed for a year and a half helping to rebuild Christchurch before returning to Seattle in 2013. She joined a committee advising Seattle on how to deal with the threat posed by its old, brick buildings. She asked officials to consider what would happen if, as in Christchurch, an earthquake displaced hundreds of businesses and tenants at one time.  Simmons favored mandatory retrofitting for Seattle\u2019s most vulnerable buildings.  For a time, it seemed like the city might do just that.  The tab  to rebuild Christchurch is estimated at $40 billion, a fifth of New Zealand\u2019s total economic output. But the economy has been buoyed by earthquake insurance, a protection most Americans don\u2019t buy.  In New Zealand, the government covers the first $100,000 of earthquake damage to every house with homeowners insurance, along with its contents and insured land. For this protection, New Zealanders pay an annual surcharge on their homeowner policies \u2014 capped at $180 \u2014 that the state collects to pay claims.  The government coverage made it more affordable for New Zealanders to purchase additional insurance from private companies, and many did. About 80 percent of the losses from the September 2010 and February 2011 quakes were insured, according to the government.  Insurance was so widespread that private insurers paid out more for the February 2011 quake than  for California\u2019s 1994 Northridge earthquake \u2014 among the most expensive natural disasters in U.S. history \u2014 even though the Christchurch quake caused less than half as much damage, according to insurer Munich Re.  \u201cThis city was the best insured city of its size ever to be hit by an earthquake of this magnitude,\u201d said Peter Townsend, chief executive of the Canterbury Employers\u2019 Chamber of Commerce.  Martin and Rae Francis, a retired couple living in a badly damaged Christchurch suburb, didn\u2019t have earthquake insurance. The government offered them $50,000 to abandon their home, they said, but even with their savings they couldn\u2019t afford to buy a new one. They\u2019ve stayed put as the government demolished every other home in their neighborhood. They dodge potholes on a road that is no longer maintained, boil their drinking water and worry about vandals.  Even those with earthquake insurance dealt with frustrations. The Earthquake Commission, the national insurer, was caught off guard by the scope of the damage and had to increase its staff from 22 to 1,064 within five months. The rate of settlements was slower on average than earthquakes in Japan and Chile around the same time, according to Marsh Risk Management, an insurance broker. (A commission spokesman said the comparison was flawed.)  Americans can seek disaster grants of up to $33,000 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or apply for low-interest loans from the Small Business Administration. Washington state\u2019s insurance regulator has said that no more than 15 percent of homeowners carry quake coverage.  \u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to rely on the federal government to ride to your rescue, you\u2019re going to be sadly disappointed,\u201d said Mike Kreidler, Washington\u2019s insurance commissioner.  Ann Brower  spent two months in a hospital with broken bones in her pelvis, left leg, left hand and lower right spine. Gradually, the public-policy professor considered the government\u2019s role in the carnage she survived.  Christchurch building officials in 1982 had flagged the building that nearly killed her as a seismic danger, but it was never retrofitted.  The Christchurch City Council, like Seattle officials, didn\u2019t require upgrades unless an owner applied for a change of use or a major renovation. The council was in the midst of crafting a new policy that set deadlines for retrofitting buildings when the first damaging earthquake struck in September 2010.  In the February 2011 earthquake, 97 percent of unreinforced-brick buildings that hadn\u2019t been retrofitted either partly collapsed or sustained severe damage and killed 42 people.  \u201cEveryone knows unreinforced brick collapses in earthquakes,\u201d Brower told The Seattle Times. \u201cThe question is why didn\u2019t anybody do something about this before?\u201d  Brower was haunted by the people who died around her and how inexpensive it would have been to secure the parts of buildings that had crushed them. She noted that building facades, gables and parapets \u2014 the brickwork that encircles a roof \u2014 are the cheapest to fortify,  and the most likely to fall in an earthquake.  Brower wrote newspaper op-eds, spoke before Parliament on legislation and secured private meetings with the building minister.  Last July, Brower accompanied a Times reporter to a gravel lot downtown, where the building that collapsed around her once stood. New Zealand\u2019s Parliament had passed what is popularly known as the \u201c Brower Amendment\u201d two months earlier, tightening deadlines to strengthen hospitals, high-occupancy buildings and unreinforced-brick structures. For those in regions of high seismic risk, they must be retrofitted within 7\u00bd years.  Brower visited Seattle after her injuries in Christchurch and took in, with dread, the number of unreinforced-masonry buildings.  \u201cThe buildings, they fall out 2\u00bd times their height,\u201d she said, \u201cso there\u2019s no place to run to.\u201d  More than a decade ago, a group of seismologists and structural engineers used a computer model to predict what a rupture of the Seattle fault might look like: the shaking would turn loose soil to mush, destroy pipelines and roads that would take years to rebuild, and kill 1,600 people. But the devastation in Christchurch offered a real-life scenario, and reports from the field poured into Seattle.  Mark Pierepiekarz, a local structural engineer, sent a colleague to Christchurch and briefed the Seattle City Council five months after the 2011 earthquake. Councilmember Tom Rasmussen toured the devastation a year later. Christchurch\u2019s mayor at the time of the quakes flew to Seattle to brief his counterpart, former Mayor Mike McGinn.  John Schelling, Washington state\u2019s lead expert on earthquake hazards, briefed the City Council in 2013 on the wreckage he saw in Christchurch. \u201cIt was essentially as if a bomb went off,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is sort of what we may be dealing with here in Washington.\u201d  Later that year, structural engineers and city officials heard from Brower herself when she spoke in Seattle at an event sponsored by the USGS.  Councilmember Richard Conlin pushed for a policy requiring retrofits of unreinforced-brick buildings. An advisory committee in 2013 proposed a mandatory retrofit policy, with deadlines based on the risk a building posed to the public. But left undecided was who would shoulder the costs of upgrades, and many building owners oppose them.  No legislation has been offered. In May, the city released a new count of unreinforced-masonry buildings, its ninth such effort over two decades. The advisory committee is scheduled to reconvene to discuss the latest survey on Dec. 6, its first meeting since 2014.  Without such a law, the most the city can do to strengthen unreinforced-masonry buildings is to wait for a tenant or owner to apply for a permit and negotiate a seismic upgrade \u2014 ranging from a full retrofit to securing a parapet.  Rasmussen, Conlin and McGinn have left city government. Schelling has taken a new job at the Department of Commerce.  Simmons, who served on the committee recommending retrofits, has returned to New Zealand. She isn\u2019t surprised Seattle hasn\u2019t moved forward with a retrofit requirement.  \u201cThere\u2019s a false sense of assurance,\u201d Simmons said of Seattleites, adding they don\u2019t grasp how devastating a Seattle fault earthquake would be. \u201cI don\u2019t think the city gets it at all,\u201d she said.  \u201cEveryone knows unreinforced brick collapses in earthquakes. The question is why didn\u2019t anybody do something about this before?\u201d  \u201cEveryone knows unreinforced brick collapses in earthquakes.
