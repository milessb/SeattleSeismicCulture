But with his family camped out in his ground-floor storefront and his support staff off tending to their households after last week\u2019s earthquake, veterinarian Pranav Raj Joshi has had to hold off operating. \u201cI hope by Monday we can do the amputations,\u201d Joshi said Saturday. \u201cThe fractures are too severe (to repair), but they\u2019ll do fine on three legs once we can complete the surgery.\u201d  In the first few days after Nepal\u2019s quake, Joshi was occupied around the clock trying to help people nearby. He pulled bodies out of collapsed brick buildings and ferried corpses to the morgue in his jeep. \u201cI was out of my head,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who I was helping; I just kept moving, moving, moving.\u201d  But with the initial human-focused search, rescue and first-aid efforts now moving past the emergency stage, Nepalese veterinarians such as Joshi, and domestic and international animal-welfare organizations and pet and livestock owners, are assessing the quake\u2019s effect on animals.  In any disaster, the death and injury of animals, and the loss of their owners or shelters, has emotional, financial and health consequences for individuals and communities. In particular, there is concern that the carcasses of dead animals could spread disease.  Surendra Maharjan, 33, lost all five cows when his neighbor\u2019s building collapsed on his livestock shed in Shova Bhagawati. He used to make about $35 a day selling milk to nearby shops.  \u201cThis was my only business, and selling milk is all that I know,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I will raise my family with all my cattle gone.\u201d  In Paslang, a hilltop farming village 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu where most homes were damaged or destroyed, residents said the quake killed two buffalo and a goat when the tin roofs of their sheds collapsed. Other cattle were hurt by falling debris.  Farming families in Paslang rely on the animals as insurance during lean harvest years, and often sell their milk. Ranamagar said the toll could have been much worse but since the quake happened at midday, many animals were out in the fields.  Properly disposing of the carcasses of dead animals is important for containing the spread of diseases like anthrax and plague. But it\u2019s not just collapsed barns that contain such contaminants.  In Bhaktapur, for example, many families raised goats on the top floors of their now-ruined three- to five-story brick homes in the warrens of the old city. On the outskirts of town, a multistory poultry house with 9,000 birds was flattened by the quake. In the center of Kathmandu, debris piles are full of pigeons that were perched in the eaves of old temples when the quake struck; the birds could not fly out fast enough.  With the government overwhelmed just trying to attend to human needs for food and shelter, animal specialists worry about a looming public-health crisis.  \u201cCarcass disposal has been a big dilemma,\u201d said Manoj Gautam, president of the Animal Welfare Network of Nepal (AWNN) and executive director of the Jane Goodall Institute Nepal.  Many pets and livestock that did survive the earthquake are homeless. In some cases, their owners died; in other cases, their now-homeless owners have been unable to take their animals with them to tent camps or back to their relatives\u2019 homes outside Kathmandu. In Bhakatpur, goats that were being raised for meat are roaming the city\u2019s ancient brick squares.  AWNN, an umbrella group, is coordinating with outside organizations such as Humane Society International to bring in veterinarians and food supplies and get the necessary vaccines and medicines for sick and injured animals.  Rahul Sehgal, Asia director for Humane Society International, said a typical Nepalese farmer would have two large animals, such as cows, and perhaps 10 small ones, such as goats.  \u201cNormally, these animals would be out grazing, but after the earthquake, with people dealing with many problems, a lot of these animals are being tethered,\u201d Sehgal said. \u201cThat leads to stress and also sanitation problems, and then there\u2019s the issue of getting food to these animals.\u201d  Groups like AWNN and Humane Society International are mindful that some people may chafe at the idea of helping animals while people still need assistance.  \u201cWhile humans are suffering so much, some people may think it\u2019s inappropriate to talk about animals,\u201d acknowledged Gautam, who lost a niece in the earthquake. \u201cSo we are trying to get aid supplies for humans and take those in parallel, so that people don\u2019t get angry.\u201d  Sehgal agreed. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in a situation where we arrive somewhere trying to help animals and there\u2019s a human dying,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery team that goes out to help animals will also help humans.\u201dCaption:  Dipika, left, and Susila hold a goat in Pahade Thapa Gaon, an agricultural village outside Kathmandu.
