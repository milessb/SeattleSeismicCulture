Police feared the number of casualties could rise even more once authorities reach remote areas, including a tiny island closest to the epicenter of the magnitude-7.9 earthquake, which struck Sunday night.      Bengkulu, a city of 250,000 about 60 miles east of the quake's epicenter beneath the Indian Ocean, was the hardest-hit.     The government emergency task force said 64 bodies had been recovered from rubble in Bengkulu  on Sumatra island's southwest coast. The rest were killed in other areas.     Many were crushed as they slept when their poorly built homes caved in. The quake cut off communications and electricity and closed the area's main airport.     In Bengkulu, tens of thousands of people spent last  night outdoors, too afraid to return home. More than 300 aftershocks have been recorded since the initial quake.          Reports said Enggano island, about 125 miles southeast of Bengkulu, was also badly hit, with up to  90 percent of its buildings  flattened.Caption:  MAPThe Seattle Times: Indonesia (map not available electronically)", "edition": "Final"}
