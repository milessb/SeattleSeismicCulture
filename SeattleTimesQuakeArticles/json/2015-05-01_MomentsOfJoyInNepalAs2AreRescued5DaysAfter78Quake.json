And then: \u201cAll of the sudden, I saw light,\u201d Pempa Tamang said, recounting the moment Thursday he was pulled from a hole at the bottom of what was once a seven-story building in the quake-stricken Nepalese capital.  Tamang did not know whether he was alive or dead. \u201cI thought I was hallucinating,\u201d he said.  The improbable rescue was an uplifting moment in Nepal, which has been overwhelmed by death and destruction since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit Saturday. By late Thursday, the government said the toll from the tremor, the most powerful recorded in the nation since 1934, had risen to 6,130 dead and 13,827 injured.  After night fell, police reported another dramatic rescue: A woman in her 20s, Krishna Devi Khadka, was pulled from a building in the same neighborhood as Tamang near Kathmandu\u2019s main bus terminal, according to an officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.  \u201cLife has become a struggle to survive. It gives us hope,\u201d said Hans Raj Joshi, who watched Tamang\u2019s rescue. \u201cWe thought they were only bringing out the dead. It\u2019s hard to believe people are still alive.\u201d  After Tamang was extricated, rescue workers inserted an IV in his arm, propped him onto a yellow plastic stretcher \u2014 the same kind that has helped convey countless dead \u2014 and carried him through the ruins on their shoulders as if he were a newly crowned king.  Lines of police stood on both sides, keeping back crowds of bystanders and journalists. A dazed Tamang, wearing a dark shirt with the New York Yankees logo and the words \u201cNew York Authentic,\u201d blinked at the bright sky.  When the procession turned a corner and entered the main road outside, there was a sound Kathmandu hadn\u2019t heard in days: jubilant cheers of thousands of ecstatic onlookers.  Nepal, however, remains far from normal. More than 70 aftershocks had been recorded in the Himalayan region by Indian scientists in the past five days, according to J.L. Gautam, director of seismology at the Indian Meteorological Department in New Delhi.  Shortages of food and water and worry over the fate of relatives, have triggered an exodus from the capital, prompting thousands to board buses provided by the government to their rural hometowns.  \u201cI have to get home. It has already been so many days,\u201d said Shanti Kumari, with her 7-year-old daughter, who was desperate to see family in her home village in eastern Nepal. \u201cI want to get at least a night of peace.\u201d  Although small shops have begun reopening and the once ubiquitous tent cities have begun thinning out, an air of desperation remains. \u201cWe\u2019re still feeling aftershocks. It still doesn\u2019t feel safe,\u201d said Prabhu Dutta, 27, a banker from Kathmandu.  Some residents have begun returning to work, including at Dutta\u2019s bank, but he said it was impossible to concentrate. \u201cWe roam around the office. We only have one topic of conversation: the earthquake.\u201d  Tamang\u2019s dark hair was disheveled, and he looked weak and tired but otherwise fine as he recounted his story in an Israeli field hospital.  When Saturday\u2019s quake began at 11:56 a.m., Tamang said he was having lunch with a friend in the hotel where he worked. As he ran downstairs, the stairs shook. He saw walls cracking, ceilings caving in.  He was in the basement when \u201csuddenly the building fell down. I thought I was about to die,\u201d he said. He fainted, and when he regained consciousness, he could see little but darkness.  He was buried face down in a tiny crevice deep in the rubble. He was terrified.  Tamang said he survived on two cans of ghee, or clarified butter. He rested his head on chunks of concrete and a broken piece of corrugated aluminum roof.  One Nepalese team had begun combing the rubble in Tamang\u2019s neighborhood, a place they had found another survivor Monday. They cried out and knocked on broken concrete slabs, and listened for any response.  Mostly there was silence. But when an officer named L. Bahadu Basnet shouted: \u201cIs anyone there?\u201d he was shocked to get a reply.  \u201cWho is there? Brother, I am here!\u201d Tamang shouted weakly back from a hole in the ground.  The team used a jack to help support the rectangular entrance, and Basnet took off his helmet, put on a headlamp and crawled inside, pushed in by his colleagues.  He could see Tamang wedged in a crevice behind a motorcycle and was shocked at how responsive he was. \u201cHe thanked me when I first approached him,\u201d Basnet said. \u201cHe told me his name, his address and I gave him some water. I assured him we were near.\u201d  It took a few hours to carefully clear the way for Tamang to be lifted out. Members of the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s Disaster Assistance Response Team brought in equipment to help and lowered a pole-mounted rotatable camera into the hole, said one of the team\u2019s members, Andrew Olvera.  At the Israeli field hospital, doctors X-rayed Tamang and injected him with glucose. Lt. Libby Weiss of the Israeli Defense Forces said he was dehydrated but lucid and \u201cin remarkably good shape,\u201d with no other injuries except scratches.  \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI think it\u2019s an amazing thing to see in the midst of all this calamity.\u201dCaption:  Nepal army forces in collaboration with an American search-and-rescue team rescue 15-year-old Pempa Tamang from a collapsed hotel in Kathmandu, Nepal, Thursday.
