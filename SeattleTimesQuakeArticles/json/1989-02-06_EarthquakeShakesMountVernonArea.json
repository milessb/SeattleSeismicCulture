Jim Zollweg, a geophysicist for the U.S. Geological Survey, said there is usually about one earthquake a year of that magnitude in the Mount Vernon area. He was working in the UW Geophysics Department lab yesterday evening and said there were several calls from people who felt the quake, but no reports of problems.
