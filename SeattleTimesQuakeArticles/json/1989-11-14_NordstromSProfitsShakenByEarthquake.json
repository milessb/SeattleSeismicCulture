A continuing impact into the current quarter, which began Nov. 1, is expected, the company said         For the three months ended Oct. 31, profits were $30 million, or 27 cents a share, up 10 percent from $19.9 million, or 24 cents a share, in the same period last year.         But the Oct. 17 quake, which took scores of lives and caused billions of dollars in damage, cost Nordstrom $1.27 million, or about 4 cents a share.         Third-quarter sales rose 18 percent, to $572,000 from $486,000.         For the first nine months, profits were $83.5 million, or $1.02 a share, vs. $75.8 million, or 93 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.", "edition": "Final"}
