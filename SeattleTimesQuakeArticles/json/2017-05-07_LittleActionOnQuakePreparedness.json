Jay Inslee signed the single seismic-safety bill passed by the Legislature this session. The original bill would have mandated annual tsunami evacuation drills for coastal schools and yearly earthquake drills for all schools, as recommended by the state Seismic Safety Committee. The final version makes the quake drills optional.  Legislation to require seismic evaluation of school buildings didn\u2019t get a hearing. A bill directing transit systems to draw up plans for restoring service after a quake died quietly.  Neither the House nor Senate proposed budgets include funding for the Washington Emergency Management Division\u2019s top legislative priority: a staffer to support Inslee\u2019s Resilient Washington State Subcabinet and help translate its recommendations into action.  It\u2019s a familiar pattern in Washington, which has a 30-year history of analyzing the state\u2019s earthquake risks \u2014 which rank second only to California\u2019s \u2014 then doing little to address them.  Inslee formed his sub-Cabinet, made up of state agency heads, last year to boost preparedness, But at last week\u2019s meeting he made it clear that \u2014 at least for now \u2014 he\u2019s looking for steps that can be taken quickly and at little cost.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we have gaps,\u201d Inslee told state agency representatives gathered around a table in the governor\u2019s conference room. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s things we can do short-term,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the larger investment issues, about seismic retrofitting, I\u2019m intrigued to hear your advice.\u201d  Among the potential quick fixes Inslee highlighted is negotiating a new contract with oil companies to guarantee shipments of fuel into the state \u2014 by sea if necessary \u2014   in the aftermath of a major quake from the offshore fault called the Cascadia Subduction Zone. He also urged the group to establish guidelines ahead of time as to who will be first in line for critical fuel supplies or power restoration.  \u201cWho gets the next tanker that shows up ... at the port?\u201d Inslee asked. \u201cDoes it go to the pizzeria down the street or to the hospital generator?\u201d  Expert panels have called repeatedly for laws that require upgrades to Washington\u2019s old brick buildings \u2014 the most dangerous structures in an earthquake. No cities in the state have yet adopted such requirements, though Seattle is considering it.  In the absence of mandated retrofits, Inslee said he was intrigued by a suggestion from the sub-Cabinet that tenants be notified of the risk posed by the buildings where they live or work.  Inslee also told the group to expand its scope to consider school safety and tsunami risks, which had been left out of the original mission.  That was good news for emergency managers, who pointed out that only one of the 20 Washington schools at risk from tsunamis has a building specifically designed to be tall and strong enough to serve as refuge.  The sub-Cabinet\u2019s only mandated responsibility is to deliver a final report by the end of June.  Any   significant progress, even in planning, will require additional money, said Robert Ezelle, director of the Washington Emergency Management Division.  \u201cWe hope that going forward we are able to secure the resources so that we can really get some traction,\u201d he said after the meeting.  State Rep. Gerry Pollet, D-Seattle, who introduced the bill that would have required seismic evaluations of school buildings, worked with colleagues to add $1.2\u2009million to the Democratic House budget to allow the state to examine some of the most vulnerable schools.  \u201cWe need to know which school buildings put our children at risk,\u201d he said.  The Republican Senate budget includes no money for the work.Caption:  Preschoolers at Hopkins Preschool in Aberdeen crouch underneath tables during an earthquake drill in teacher Michelle Weiberg\u2019s class.
