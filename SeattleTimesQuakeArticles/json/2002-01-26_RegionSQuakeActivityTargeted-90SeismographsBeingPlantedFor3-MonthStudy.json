A network of about 90 seismographs is being buried around Puget Sound -- in flower beds, under decks, alongside businesses -- for a three-month study of how the region responds to earthquakes large and small. Yesterday, the devices -- in heavy gray plastic carrying cases -- were lined up in a spare ground-level room at North Seattle Community College's High-Tech Learning Center. In the next several days, volunteers will plant them in a grid extending north to Everett, south to Tacoma and west to the Olympic Peninsula. The focus is the Seattle Basin, an area about 17 miles wide, 50 miles long and 5 miles deep, said Thomas Pratt, one of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists leading the study. The devices will record shaking from the region's small daily quakes and from larger temblors occurring around the world, where about a half-dozen magnitude 7 to 7.5 quakes occur each year. The data will further define the basin and enable scientists to fine-tune seismic models of the region's response to shaking. The study -- the fourth in a series called Seismic Hazards Investigation in Puget Sound, or SHIPS -- is being conducted by the community college, USGS, the University of Washington and the National Science Foundation-financed Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology. The research will help scientists predict the behavior of seismic  waves that get trapped in the basin, Pratt said.", "edition": "Fourth"}
