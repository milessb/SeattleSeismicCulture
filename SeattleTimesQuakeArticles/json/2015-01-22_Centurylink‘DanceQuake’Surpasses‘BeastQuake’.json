The experts say the biggest event was caused by all the jumping and dancing that followed the touchdown and two-point conversion as Seattle rallied toward the end of regulation time.  The University of Washington\u2019s Steve Malone calls it a \u201cdance quake\u201d generated by bouncing fans.  Malone says that dance quake was the biggest seismic signal associated with a Seahawks game \u2014 even bigger than the 2011 \u201cbeast quake\u201d that followed a Marshawn Lynch touchdown run and originally drew the attention of earthquake trackers.  Other earthshaking events Sunday were Seattle\u2019s fake field-goal touchdown and the winning touchdown in overtime.Caption:  The celebration following the two-point conversion in the Seahawks\u2019 win  over the Packers was the biggest \u201cquake\u201d yet.
