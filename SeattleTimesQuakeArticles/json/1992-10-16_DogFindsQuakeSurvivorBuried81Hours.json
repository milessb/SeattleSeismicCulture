Aktham Ismail Hamouda, 37, was found alive but dazed, clutching the hands of his dead Italian wife, Tiziana Trevisani, and his mother and daughter, both named Samira.     More than 60 bodies had been recovered from the debris of the building in the middle-class residential area of Heliopolis.     \"Loggi . . . went into the debris through a very small hole. He came out and barked four times. I knew he had found someone alive,\" the dog's handler, Joulyne Pointeau, said today.     The team from French group Action D'Urgence International flew to Cairo Wednesday to assist in rescue operations after Monday's earthquake, which claimed more than 530 lives.     \"We never lose hope. We found a woman alive nine days later in Mexico,\" said team member Catherine Hugary, who also assisted after the 1985 Mexican earthquake.     She and the team's 74-year-old leader, Pierre Rasquier, worked for four hours clearing a passage and eased Hamouda out shortly after midnight.     He was taken to a hospital, whose general manager, Samiri Sultan, quoted him as saying: \"We recovered consciousness after the building collapsed. I drank my urine, but they refused. My daughter wanted a soft drink.\"      Hamouda's left ankle was dislocated and fractured.     \"All his vital signs are normal; mentally he is fine, but psychologically he is stressed. He is a very strong guy,\" attending doctor Hany Zaky said.     Hamouda's sister Elham was rescued from the same site eight hours after the quake.", "edition": "Final"}
