While a Rack discount store re-opened a week after the quake, a full-line department store located about five miles from the temblor's epicenter won't reopen until late February, spokeswoman Kellie Tormey said.     Tormey said it is too early to determine the financial impact of the closure. Nordstrom's four other L.A.-area stores were not affected.", "edition": "Final"}
