Or perhaps Seahawks fans have become accustomed to winning in the past three years. Whatever the reason, University of Washington scientists   say the peak ground shaking during Saturday\u2019s playoff game against the New Orleans Saints \u2014 while sufficiently strong to jolt   several seismometers \u2014 fell short of the electrifying Beast Quake of January 2011.  \u201cBeast Quake One was both larger and lasted longer than Beast Quake Two,\u201d said Paul Bodin of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network . \u201cBut not by a huge amount.\u201d  Initially, seismologists thought Saturday\u2019s rumblings \u2014 which spiked during running back Marshawn Lynch\u2019s game-winning touchdown run \u2014 were more intense. But when Bodin compared those signals to the ones recorded on the same seismometer in 2011 \u2014 when Lynch\u2019s 67-yard touchdown run powered an underdog Seattle team to victory over New Orleans \u2014 it was clear that the first was bigger.   Saturday\u2019s crowd did kick up more of a racket after the key touchdown, Bodin said, reflecting reaction to the extra-point kick and the JumboTron replay.  The term Beast Quake was inspired by Lynch\u2019s nickname, Beast Mode.  Seattle\u2019s raucous fans   will have another chance to shatter their seismic record Sunday, when the Seahawks face the San Francisco 49ers in  the NFC title game.  The scientists from UW plan to install a third seismometer at CenturyLink Field before the game. They also hope to move one of the two instruments they installed previously, because it picked up a steady hum from a nearby motor throughout Saturday\u2019s game.  \u201cThe management of the stadium is very cooperative,\u201d said PNSN director John Vidale. \u201cI think their attitude is that we help intimidate the opposition.\u201d  While fun for both scientists and fans, the exercise also has a more serious purpose, Vidale pointed out. Quickly deploying seismometers is good training for what he and his team will do when the next big earthquake strikes the region. The keen interest in all things Seahawks   gives the scientists a taste of the heavy traffic their website is likely to get after a major quake \u2014 and some of the results weren\u2019t pretty.  A site set up to allow fans to check seismic signals in real time quickly crashed.  But the instruments themselves worked well, picking up vibrations from the collective stomping of feet and general commotion during key plays. Graduate student Kelley Long  used the signals from one instrument to compile a seismic play-by-play of the game, posted on the PNSN website.  Whatever happens Sunday, the scientists gathered at the UW seismology lab will know about it before the television audience. The broadcast is delayed by 10 seconds, but the seismometer signals aren\u2019t. So the seismologists have only to watch their readings   to predict if a play is likely to end with stomping and celebration \u2014 or collective slumping.Memo:  Sandi Doughton at: 206-464-2491 or sdoughton@seattletimes.com", "edition": "Unknown"}
