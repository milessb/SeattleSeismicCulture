The 3.7 quake occurred at 8:50 p.m., about seven miles southwest of Bremerton. \"We do not expect any damage or injuries because the earthquake magnitude is relatively low,\" said Joshua Jones of the Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network. The quake, 14 miles deep, was felt in Tacoma and Eatonville to the south and as far east as Issaquah, about 35 miles away. Fire and law-enforcement agencies in Kitsap County received no emergency calls or reports of damage, according to officials with the Sheriff's Office. State Department of Transportation inspectors checked Interstate 90 and the 520 floating bridge, as well as the Alaskan Way Viaduct. As of late last night, there were no signs of damage.Caption:  mapThe Seattle Times: 3.7 quake rattles Puget sound area (G5TFRR8Q)", "edition": "Fourth"}
