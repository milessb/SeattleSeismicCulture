Some, huddling silently and teary-eyed at one entrance, had come to identify the bodies of missing loved ones.  Others, jockeying for a place in long lines for water and food, told stories of close calls.  \u201cIt was only after the earthquake finished that we could get out of the house,\u201d said Angelica Valencia, 30, clutching a gallon of water and surrounded by her three young children. \u201cIt was terrifying, and now we\u2019re sleeping on the street.\u201d  Pedernales, a sleepy tourist town of pastel-colored concrete houses, was shaken Saturday evening by the quake, which injured more than 2,000 people.  President Rafael Correa, who rushed back from a visit to Italy, said that finding survivors was the main priority.  \u201cThe whole country is mobilizing,\u201d he said on Twitter, adding that Pedernales was \u201cdestroyed.\u201d  The death toll here has reached at least 91, most of whom have been identified, police Gen. Milton Zarate said. Bodies, some covered by black tarps, were arranged under tents in one corner of the stadium.  About 600 people were treated at clinics and a pop-up first aid station in the stadium, the Ecuadoran Red Cross said.  Rescue operations would continue through the night, officials said, as long as intermittent rain did not make conditions too treacherous for rescue teams.  Many residents, fearful of aftershocks, said that they planned to sleep outside. The interiors of some houses were fully visible, their outside walls knocked away but their foundations left standing.  Some of the 1,100 police officers brought into the area were packed into pickup beds as night fell, deploying to points around the city to protect residents sleeping outdoors without electricity.  \u201cYou can still hear people calling for help \u2014 we can\u2019t get to them,\u201d said Luis Flores, 41. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d  The quake, the country\u2019s worst in decades, collapsed buildings and buckled roads along the Pacific Coast. A state of emergency was declared in six provinces.  \u201cEverything can be rebuilt, but lives cannot be recovered, and that\u2019s what hurts the most,\u201d Correa said on state radio.  Several major roadways remained closed Sunday because of damage and concerns about possible landslides. Others were closed at sunset.  Photos posted on social media showed roads broken into pieces.  The Esmeraldas oil refinery, key to the oil producer\u2019s economy, halted output after the quake.  A bridge in Guayaquil, Ecuador\u2019s largest city, collapsed after the quake. Other bridges across the country were undergoing safety checks.  Portoviejo, the provincial capital of Manab, and Pedernales, a resort town, appeared to have sustained the most damage, with about 370 buildings destroyed.  Viviana Baquezea, 34, a florist, was driving back to her home in Portoviejo, accompanied by her parents and an employee, when the earthquake struck. They were met by a scene of destruction.  \u201cIt looks like a war zone,\u201d Baquezea said by telephone from Portoviejo.  Residents who were evacuated from coastal towns because of fears of a tsunami would be allowed to return to their homes, said Vice President Jorge Glas, who visited disaster sites Sunday.  \u201cNo Ecuadoran is alone,\u201d Glas tweeted. \u201cWe will come out of this emergency stronger.\u201d  Ecuador has a history of destructive earthquakes, but the one Saturday, which by some accounts lasted more than a minute, is believed to have been one of the most powerful since the 1970s. Some geologists said its force was 20 times greater than the deadly earthquake that struck southern Japan early Saturday.  The quake had a depth of nearly 12 miles. Several aftershocks, some as strong as magnitude 5.6, followed. The earthquake\u2019s center was 16 miles southeast of Muisne, Ecuador, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
