Santa Anita in Arcadia, northeast of Los Angeles, went ahead with its racing card, and there were no immediate reports of damage to other stadiums and arenas in the area.    At Anaheim Stadium, about 30 miles south of Los Angeles and some 50 miles from Northridge, which was believed to be the epicenter of the quake, the damage to the billboards and the giant replay screen was extensive.    The large \"A\" outside the park, a familiar symbol of the stadium used by the California Angels and Los Angeles Rams, appeared undamaged.    But the quake tipped over the facade in the left-field corner and another \"A\" logo in the stadium.    Bret Colson, an Anaheim city spokesman, estimated the damage at $3.4 million, \"which hurts, simply because our deductible is 5 percent of the value of the structure,\" he said, making the deductible $6.25 million.", "edition": "Second"}
