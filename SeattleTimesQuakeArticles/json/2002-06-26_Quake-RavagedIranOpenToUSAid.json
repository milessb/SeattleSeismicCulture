Khatami yesterday visited families of some of those who perished in Saturday's magnitude-6.1 quake in Iran's northwest. Earlier in the day, a moderate magnitude-4 quake and several aftershocks jolted already-devastated areas, forcing terrified villagers to sleep outside. \"No one wants to take a chance,\" said Hajj Ebrahim Nazari, an ironmonger. Asked by reporters about U.S. offers to send aid to Iran, Khatami said \"we don't expect any aid, but we would accept any aid without conditions.\" Iran had previously stipulated that it would receive U.S. aid only from unofficial organizations. Iran and America have no diplomatic ties and relations are marked by hostility. In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the administration was aware of Iran's interest. \"Steps are under way to get things moving,\" he said.Caption:  photoKamran Jebreili / The Associated Press : With their destroyed village in the background, earthquake survivors start a new day at their tents in Iran's Abdareh village.
