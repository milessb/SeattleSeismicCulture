The quake, felt by some area residents just before midnight Friday, was of magnitude 3.6 - at the very low end of temblors that can be felt by people nearby, scientists say. It was followed by two small aftershocks. No injuries or property damage were reported.     The UW lab said the quake occurred at 11:43 p.m. and was centered about 10 miles west of Mount Rainier and about 5.5 miles  underground.", "edition": "Final"}
