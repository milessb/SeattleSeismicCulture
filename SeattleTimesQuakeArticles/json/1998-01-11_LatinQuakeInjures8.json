The Seismological Monitoring Station in Guatemala City reported a 5.8-magnitude quake followed by a 4.4-magnitude temblor. Mexico's National Seismological Service detected the same quake but registered it at 6.3, and reported temblors of 4.4 and 4.8.     Mexican seismologist Javier Pacheco said better monitoring equipment in Mexico accounted for the difference in reported magnitudes.     Guatemalan authorities said the epicenter of the first quake was off the Pacific coast near the Mexican border, about 90 miles southwest of Guatemala City. The second was about 13 miles farther out to sea.", "edition": "Final"}
