The system did not alert the public Oct. 24 when a quake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale rattled Mexico City. The quake caused power outages and panic as well as public skepticism about the monitoring system that increased with this week's false alarm.   The system will be changed so a general alarm will not be sounded unless the control center in Mexico City receives earthquake signals from two warning stations.", "edition": "Final"}
