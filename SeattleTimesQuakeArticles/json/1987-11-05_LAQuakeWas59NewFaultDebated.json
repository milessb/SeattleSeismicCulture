Seismologists also said that there is a growing consensus that the quake occurred on a previously unknown fault, buried 9 to 12 miles underground, that stretches from Rosemead, 10 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, through Los Angeles and Santa Monica and out to sea off the cost of Malibu.        This fault and others like it may represent a previously unknown potential for earthquakes, said Thomas Davis, an independent geologist who is studying the area under a contract with the U.S. Geological Survey. Davis said the Whittier temblor, which caused seven deaths and produced $213 million in damage, was the fourth earthquake of magnitude 5 or larger to have occurred along the fault since 1929. The other three were all offshore and were in 1929, 1930 and 1973.     Some scientists argue that the extent of the fault has not yet been documented, while others say that even if the fault exists, geologic strains on it could be relieved by mechanisms other than earthquakes.", "edition": "First"}
