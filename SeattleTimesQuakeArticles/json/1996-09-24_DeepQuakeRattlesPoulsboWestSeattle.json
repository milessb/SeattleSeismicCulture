The quake at 5:45 a.m. was centered about 15 miles west of Poulsbo and occurred 30 miles below the earth's surface, said Bill Steele, seismology-lab coordinator at the University of Washington.    \"This earthquake occurred beneath the Juan de Fuca Plate as it's descending beneath Western Washington,\" said Steele. \"That's the same area where we got the 1949 and 1965 earthquakes (of 7.1 and 6.5 magnitudes). Those were deep earthquakes as well, but this one was much smaller.\"     The temblor was felt as far away as West Seattle.  No damage or injuries were reported.", "edition": "Final"}
