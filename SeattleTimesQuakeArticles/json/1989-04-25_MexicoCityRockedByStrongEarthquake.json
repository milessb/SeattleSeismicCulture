Ambulances raced around the capital, sirens blaring, but there were no immediate reports of injuries from the tremor.        Preliminary indications were that the quake registered 6.8 on the Richter scale.        The tremor shook Mexico City at about the same time of day as the large earthquake that struck Sept. 19, 1985, killing at least 10,000 people and knocking down hundreds of buildings.        Today's earthquake knocked out power and telephone service.          A 19-story building that houses the Health Ministry's budget office suffered considerable damage as plaster fell, according to evacuees.     Carlos Bravo, who works in the penthouse offices, said, ``It was horrible. There was hysteria. Parts of the ceiling fell, but they were not big enough to hurt anyone. Some of us calmed many people and made them go down the stairway.'", "edition": "Third"}
