Geological evidence points to a quake the size of which the island has not seen in centuries, Ron Hyndman, a senior researcher for the Geological Survey of Canada, said Wednesday.    \"The shaking will do the biggest damage and will last for minutes,\" he said.    The damage would be more severe than recent earthquakes in California, which were a magnitude 7. The earthquake expected here could be a magnitude 9.    Hyndman said native tradition recalls just such an earthquake, which struck the island fault line on Jan. 26, 1700. Successive 33-foot-high tsunamis caused by the earthquake devastated the Japanese coast.    \"There is a 10 percent chance of this in the next 50 years,\" Hyndman said, but it could happen at any time in the next 1,000 years.    He said satellite measurements of the Earth's warping show Vancouver Island's coast has been rising 0.16 inch a year.    In the 1700 earthquake, the coast dropped three to six feet.     The last two magnitude 9 earthquakes were in Chile in 1960 and in Alaska in 1964.", "edition": "Weekend"}
