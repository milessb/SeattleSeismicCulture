An earthquake shook northern Vancouver Island Friday night, the third temblor along Canada's West Coast in less than a week. No damage or injuries were reported.        Gary Rogers of the Pacific Geoscience Center said the latest quake measured 5 on the Richter scale and was felt in parts of the sparsely populated northern part of the island.
