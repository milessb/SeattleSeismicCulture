A representative of the aid agency Doctors Without Borders said the earthquake, which struck last Wednesday, had claimed about 4,200 lives.     \"If we don't receive food soon, we'll die of hunger,\" said villager Abdurahman, 35.  His brother and nephew were killed in the disaster.     Ghanj was said to be the worst-hit of up to 28 villages in the country's northern region of Rustaq, where 1,800 people died in last week's earthquake and another, smaller quake over the weekend.     The villagers' enemy is now the biting cold and heavy mists that have prevented aircraft from bringing aid to the remote area.     \"The main problem is now the weather,\" said Sheila Hall, medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, who said the agency's estimate for total dead was now 4,200.     A continuing civil war is also a major logistical headache for aid agencies trying to operate in the mountainous republic of 20 million people.", "edition": "Final"}
