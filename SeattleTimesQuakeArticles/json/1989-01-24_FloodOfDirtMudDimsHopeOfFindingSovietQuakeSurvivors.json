Porubcansky", "text": "MOSCOW - Rescuers probed with bulldozers and shovels today for survivors in the soggy mass of dirt and rock an earthquake sent crashing into three Central Asian mountain villages.        The official Tass news agency estimated 1,000 people were killed in slides loosened by the tremor as it struck a rich agricultural region of the Soviet republic of Tadzhikistan before dawn yesterday.        ``There is little hope (of finding survivors) because of the flood of dirt and mud,'' Erkin Kasimov, a spokesman for the republic's foreign ministry, said today. ``But while there is any hope, the rescuers will keep working.''        Rescuers put up tents and built huts for survivors and worked to restore communications and electricity, he said.        Official reports said more than 100 people were hospitalized in the Tadzhik capital of Dushanbe, 20 miles from where the Soviet Union's second devastating earthquake in two months had caused the most destruction.        Vitaly Zhukov, deputy head of the republic's official news agency, said 11 people died during the night in Dushanbe hospitals.        The Communist Party newspaper Pravda blamed the conditions for mudslides on heavy snows followed by a thaw in hills overlooking the stricken villages of Sharora, Okuli-Bolo and Okuli-Poyen.             The thaw moistened the earthen walls of canals that stretched down to the villages, and when the quake hit, the rich earth loosened and Pravda said it ``moved in a huge mass onto the villages'' - about 1 1/2 to 1 1/4 miles.            ``There is a danger of new mudslides in similar places in the event of a new natural blow,'' the paper said.        Pravda said previous experience had shown that the Soviet Union is careless in construction of buildings, especially in rural areas. However, it did not specifically blame poor construction for any of the deaths in the area about 1,800 miles southeast of Moscow.        Poorly constructed apartment buildings had been blamed for many of the estimated 25,000 deaths in the earthquake that struck northwestern Armenia Dec. 7. That quake registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.        The U.S. Geological Survey said yesterday's quake measured 5.4 on the scale.", "edition": "First"}
