The quake, which occurred at 1:38 p.m., was centered about 10 miles southwest of Bremerton in Kitsap County, said Professor Stephen Malone of the University of Washington geophysics program.         Seattle and King County and Kitsap County police all received calls about the earthquake but no reports of damage. People reported ``just a lot of shaking around,'' said a dispatcher for King County Police. The Bremerton, Tacoma and Olympia offices of the Washington State Patrol reported similar calls.         Because the quake was centered 30 miles below the earth's surface, the shock was felt throughout the region and not localized enough to cause damage, Malone said.         He said quakes of that magnitude occur in the Puget Sound region three or four times a year.         ``All of a sudden it felt like someone shoved my chair about three inches,'' said Fidel Alvarez, who lives on Beacon Hill. He said a mirror he has hung on his wall just to measure temblors continued to sway for about a minute.         ``I felt the whole bedroom move,'' said Ruth Zanoni, who was in a chair feeding her baby. Zanoni lives at Kitsap County's Bangor Naval submarine base on Hood Canal.         The ``light earthquake'' was felt as far north as Victoria, B.C., according to the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.         An earthquake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A magnitude 7 quake is a major earthquake, capable of widespread damage.", "edition": "Final"}
