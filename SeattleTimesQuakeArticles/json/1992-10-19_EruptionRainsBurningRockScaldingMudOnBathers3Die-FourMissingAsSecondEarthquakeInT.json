Three were reported killed and the mayor said today that four were missing    The sheriff of another town that was cut off by yesterday's quake reported today that 90 percent of the dwellings in his village were destroyed, forcing 3,500 people to move into tents. He said no one was killed.    The quake was the second to strike Colombia in two days. Two people were reported dead in other villages, and about 100 were injured in the region.    Although the temblor was measured at 7.2 on the Richter scale by the U.S. Geological Survey - a potentially devastating magnitude - there were no reports of widespread damage or casualties. EARLIER QUAKE WAS 6.6     A quake registering 6.6 on Saturday leveled much of the town of Murindo, 90 miles northwest of Bogota, but no deaths were reported.    State Gov. Juan Gomez said today that nearly all of Murindo's adobe, tin-roofed shacks that survived Saturday's quake collapsed yesterday. He said the town's 5,000 residents were being helped to move to other towns.    During yesterday's quake, molten rock, steam and scalding mud spewed from a depression on Cacaqual Mountain onto a sparsely populated area on the outskirts of this town of 2,500 people about 125 miles northwest of Medellin. 2 KNOWN DEAD     Mayor Alcides Caballero told the Caracol radio network today that two people were known to have died in the eruption, including one woman engulfed by the 9-foot-deep flow of hot mud. An injured woman also died overnight, officials said later today. Caballero said four people were missing.    The town's hospital said 42 people were treated for injuries, most second-degree burns. Officials said the injured included a husband and wife and nine of their 11 children.    Witnesses said the hot mud spewed from a depression about the size of a baseball field that had been 30 feet deep. By today the area had swelled into a mound about 300 feet high. Mud covered an area about 1,000 yards across.    About 70 miles south, in the town of Vajira, nearly all the dwellings were destroyed or damaged by the earthquake but no one was killed, Sheriff Alberto Zulaga told RCN radio today. He said all but 500 of the town's 4,000 residents were living in tents and shelters improvised from plastic and other materials.    Zulaga said boiling mud was seeping from cracks in the earth caused by the quake.    Many of the victims at San Pedro de Uraba were bathing in thermal pools at the base of Cacaqual Mountain.    Although local people refer to the 1,500-foot mountain as a volcano, a scientist at the Cali Seismological Institute, Hans Meyer, said today that the mud flow was caused by the liquification of sandy soil by superhot, underground water.    \"When the earth started shaking we saw a sudden blaze of fire that shot up from the volcano,\" San Pedro councilman Teofilo Santana told the RCN radio network.    In Bogota, the capital city of 6 million, and in Medellin, a city of 3 million, people ran out of shaking buildings into the streets during the earthquake. Traffic lights swung wildly.    Colombia lies over three shifting geological plates, so serious earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are not unusual.    The last major eruption, on Nov. 13, 1985, killed 23,000 people, mainly in the town of Armero. The Nevado del Ruiz volcano melted part of a glacier, sending a 100-foot-high wall of mud and rock down on the town.    A temblor measuring 7.9 killed 800 people in Colombia and Ecuador in 1979.    The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph.Caption:  MAP: PHOTO1) AP: MURINDO EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE (MAP NOT AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY)2) AP: TWO YOUNGSTERS WALK ALONG A CRACK IN THE EARTH IN MURINDO, A FISHING VILLAGE IN COLOMBIA.
