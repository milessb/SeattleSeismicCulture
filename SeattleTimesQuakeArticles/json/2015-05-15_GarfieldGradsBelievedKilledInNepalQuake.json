Bailey Meola and Sydney Schumacher, both 19, had been trekking in Nepal\u2019s Langtang Valley when the earthquake hit in late April. The families believe they \u201cperished during the earthquake and catastrophic landslide,\u201d the two families posted on social media.  \u201cWhen Sydney\u2019s brothers, Will and Paul, searched the entirety of the trek, and saw the immense and unfathomable destruction and devastation, it was clear that there was no chance our girls had survived,\u201d the families wrote. \u201cAlthough our strong desire has been to hear final confirmation from the U.S. Embassy, and to receive our girls\u2019 remains, we haven\u2019t, and may never.\u201d  Meola and Schumacher were traveling around the world after graduating from Garfield High School in 2014. The two met in Thailand in mid-April before flying to Kathmandu. Schumacher\u2019s five-month journey began in January; she wrote on her travel blog of her plans to work on a farm in Hawaii after hiking in Nepal. Meola flew to Southeast Asia in February and planned to travel through Europe after the Langtang Valley trek.  A crowdfunding page on Indiegogo, intended to raise money for locating and extracting Meola and Schumacher, generated more than $51,000. The initial goal for the page, set up a few days after the devastating quake on April 25, was $500.  \u201cWe have been profoundly moved by the support and love we have received from near and from far, far away,\u201d the families wrote.  With the funds from more than 600 donors, the Meola and Schumacher families formed a private expedition team to search in medical and makeshift camps throughout the Langtang Valley. Schumacher\u2019s brothers flew to Kathmandu two weeks ago and were directly involved in the search-and-rescue efforts. They returned to Seattle earlier this week.  In the weeks after the earthquake that killed thousands of people, the families continued to hope that the two girls would be found alive. They had been told by the U.S. embassy that there was a chance there were more survivors.  Chris Olson, Meola\u2019s godfather, said the families remained hopeful after the earthquake because the girls were experienced in survival skills and outdoor activities.  \u201cBailey is an amazing, adventurous person,\u201d Olson said at a candlelight vigil held last week. \u201cThere was no stopping her going on this trip. She was really excited to get to Nepal.\u201d  They had learned many skills through POST, a student-run outdoor education leadership program at Garfield. The program taught them where to look for shelter and warmth in natural surroundings, how to build a fire in wet conditions and how to focus thoughts and actions on the best steps to survive.  Organizers at the vigil handed out a list of items and tips for surviving in the wilderness.  \u201cBailey and Sydney\u2019s story is as much a story of their own survival as a reminder to all of us that the events of Nepal can happen anywhere, at anytime,\u201d Rachelle Brown, Meola\u2019s mother, wrote on the list.  The families said Thursday that the money from the Indiegogo fund will be donated to continuing relief efforts in Nepal, which was hit with another large aftershock earlier this week.  \u201cIn due time we will announce our direction with donations made to our Indiegogo, to aid the people & economy of the Langtang Valley region in the names of our beautiful daughters,\u201d the families wrote. \u201cYou have all had your part in helping us move through these dark days.\u201dCaption:  Bailey Meola, left, and Sydney Schumacher were hiking in the Langtang region of Nepal when the 7.8 quake hit last month.
