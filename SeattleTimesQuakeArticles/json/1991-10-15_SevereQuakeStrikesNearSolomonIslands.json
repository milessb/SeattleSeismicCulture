The epicenter of the quake, recorded shortly after midnight Hong Kong time, was about 112 miles west-northwest of Honiara. There was no word of damage.     The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.     Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 times greater.", "edition": "Final"}
