The News Interest Index, a monthly poll of 1,300 adults produced by the Times Mirror Center for People and the Press, found that seven in 10 Americans surveyed said they paid very close attention to the Los Angeles riots.      In the six years since the center began such surveys, only the shuttle explosion in 1986 and the San Francisco earthquake in 1989 were followed as closely.    Asked to assess the media's handling of the riots, 52 percent of blacks criticized it as only fair or poor, while 66 percent of whites rated it as excellent or good.", "edition": "Final"}
