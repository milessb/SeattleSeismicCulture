Bridges, levees, roads and county buildings were undamaged in the region's strongest quake in 30 years, but it took nearly an hour for members of the county's Office of Emergency Management to talk with one another.     Staffers could not break through jammed circuit lines as more than 350 calls to 911 were recorded. Cellular airwaves were equally gridlocked, county officials said at a news conference yesterday.     To reduce the number of emergency calls to 911, the county will expand an education program, designed to help the public help themselves during a natural disaster", "edition": "First"}
