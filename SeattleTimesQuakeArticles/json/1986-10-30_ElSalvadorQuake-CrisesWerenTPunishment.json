This country does not deserve punishment for anything it has done any more than any of us     When disaster hits, we are called to respond to those in need as caring, concerned neighbors. Punishment should not be part of our thoughts, for that makes the receiver look like a ``less than'' being helped by a generous, paternalistic big brother. A small country bordering a huge, rich country has enough trouble with their self esteem without our displaying such an attitude. El Salvador has suffered three crippling crises. Let us reach out to them with care and the respect they deserve.     - Gwen Beighle, Seattl", "edition": "Third"}
