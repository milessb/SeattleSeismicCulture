(AP) _ An earthquake capable of causing considerable damage rocked a largely uninhabited area of the Mexican desert 65 miles southwest of here, but there were no reports of damage or injuries, authorities said        The quake measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale hit late yesterday afternoon and was followed by a series of aftershocks, including one that registered a 4.3 Richter reading, said Dennis Meredith, a spokesman for the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.        He said the initial jolt was felt as far away as San Diego, 110 miles northwest of the quake's epicenter.        The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph.        Every increase of one number _ for example, from 4.2 to 5.2 _ corresponds to a tenfold increase in energy.        A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage in populated areas; one of  magnitude 5 temblor can cause considerable damage.", "edition": "Fourth"}
