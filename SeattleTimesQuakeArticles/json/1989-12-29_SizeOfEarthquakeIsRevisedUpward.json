She also said the lab had received the first report of damage from the quake. A Kirkland woman called to say the quake caused cracks in the sliding doors, ceilings and windows of the first floor of her apartment building.         The tremor was felt from the Canadian border to Portland, Ore.         ``Magnitudes are calculated in different ways and we measured the quake between 4.9 and 5.1'' after reviewing additional data, Jonientz-Trisler said.         The quake was centered 10 miles below the earth's surface just outside Ashford, at the southwest corner of Mount Rainier National Park. The quake hit at 12:48 a.m. PST and was followed by small aftershocks a few hours later.         The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion in which every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. A reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.", "edition": "Final"}
