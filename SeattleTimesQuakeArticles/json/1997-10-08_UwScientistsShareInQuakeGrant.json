PEER also has a matching $10 million grant from the UW, Washington State Department of Transportation and other sources.     Steve Kramer, a UW civil engineering professor, said the region is susceptible to devastating quakes that last for several minutes, as well as the shorter earthquakes experienced recently.     \"These longer-duration earthquakes will have very specific impacts on soils and structures that we need to understand better,\" Kramer said.", "edition": "Final"}
