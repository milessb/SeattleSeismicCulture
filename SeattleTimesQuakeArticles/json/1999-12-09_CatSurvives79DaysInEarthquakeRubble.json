The animal apparently kept itself alive by eating another cat, veterinarian Chen Tao-chieh said. The head, tail, bones and bits of fur from the second feline were found next to the survivor, Chen said.    It was not known how the gray and white cat kept itself from dying of thirst.    Workers discovered the animal yesterday in a damaged house that had been vacated and locked up before the Sept. 21 quake in the central city of Taichung, 81 miles south of Taipei.    The cat was trapped under a large white message board that fell off the wall and pinned it to the ground.    The cat was severely dehydrated and barely breathing when it was brought to the National Veterinary Hospital in Taichung, Chen said.    It weighed less than 4.4 pounds, half the weight of a healthy cat that size, he said.    TV reports today showed the cat lying limp in an incubator-like container as a worker fed it nutritional formula with a syringe.    Taiwan's worst earthquake in decades killed about 2,400 people and demolished tens of thousands of buildings, mostly near the quake's epicenter in central Taiwan.Caption:  PHOTOTING CHIH-KUAN / AP: A VETERINARIAN EXAMINES A CAT THAT WAS FOUND YESTERDAY TRAPPED IN A HOUSE DAMAGED BY TAIWAN'S SEPT. 21 EARTHQUAKE.", "edition": "Final"}
