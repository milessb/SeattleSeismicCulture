There were no immediate reports of casualties in the tremor, which registered 6 points on the Richter scale and had its epicenter about 12 miles offshore from the Pacific port of Valparaiso, the Chilean Seismological Institute said.        The earthquake woke up most of the population, but there was no panic and hospital officials reported no injuries.        Officials said buildings badly damaged by the quake March 3 collapsed in the coastal region between the ports of San Antonio and Valparaiso.        At least 150 people were killed and more than 2,000 injured by the earthquake two weeks ago, which damaged or destroyed 60,000 houses and left 500,000 people homeless.", "edition": "Fourth"}
