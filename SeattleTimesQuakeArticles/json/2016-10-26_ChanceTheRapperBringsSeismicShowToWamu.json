But instead of a natural disaster, the raucous evening was the product of the coy-yet-ascendant Chicago-born lyricist Chance the Rapper (aka Chancellor Bennett), who beseeched his fans to bounce in unison as he spat his songs onstage proudly and confidently, effortlessly hypnotizing them.  The rapper, who released an acclaimed mixtape, \u201cAcid Rap,\u201d in 2013 and a critically beloved follow-up, 2016\u2019s \u201cColoring Book,\u201d earning millions of streams and downloads, had swarms of hands shooting through the air while hundreds of feet lifted and landed \u2014 all while a trumpet echoed behind him and neon-green lights splayed over everything.  \u201cShould we turn it up?\u201d asked Bennett, known for songs infused with gospel music and social consciousness.  The crowd agreed, with supreme enthusiasm. \u201cOK, let\u2019s shake this!\u201d he exclaimed.  And the house shook \u2014 bleachers and all.  Bennett is part of a new wave of carefree rappers that includes Vince Staples and Childish Gambino. He is featured on Macklemore and Ryan Lewis\u2019 latest album and slated to perform soon at the White House.  Wearing jeans, T-shirt and a baseball cap,   Bennett held the youthful, eager Seattle audience in the palm of his hand for the duration of the night \u2014 impressive, since the 23-year-old performer has only been on entertainment\u2019s main stage for about three years.  The rapper moved effortlessly between party anthems and confessionals, spitting at one point, \u201cShe used to laugh at my jokes,\u201d as if a tear might fall down his face.  Booming on the mic, he moved agilely though his catalog, the highlight of which was his thoughtful \u201cAll We Got,\u201d as the crowd sang along.  At one point the rapper called for gallons of glitter to be released like raindrops over his fans, as they screamed.  \u201cSeems like we\u2019re enjoying this path,\u201d he said of the energetic vibe of the night.  He couldn\u2019t have been more right.Caption:  Chance The Rapper, shown here in London earlier this year, performed at WaMu Theater Monday, Oct. 24.
