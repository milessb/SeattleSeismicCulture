The Palmer-based Tsunami Warning Center said the quake was centered 160 miles southwest of Anchorage.     There were no immediate reports of injury or damage. The quake was felt in a region from Palmer to Kodiak - about 300 miles north to south.     At Anchorage, the state's largest city, the quake lasted several seconds and felt like a series of gentle rolls.     There was no threat of a tidal wave, said Alec Medbery, a center spokesman.", "edition": "Final"}
