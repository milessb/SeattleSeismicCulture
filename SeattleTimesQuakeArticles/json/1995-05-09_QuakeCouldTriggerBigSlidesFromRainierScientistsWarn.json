The National Research Council warned of Mount Rainier's eruptive potential in 1994. Now USGS is warning of mudflows that could be triggered by something other than an eruption, such as an earthquake.     While infrequent - big ones occur about every 500 to 1,000 years - the mudflows could be devastating.     Mount Rainier is the new focus of attention because it is the highest and most inherently unstable peak and the closest to large populationsCaption:  PHOTOTOM REESE / SEATTLE TIMES: HYDROLOGIST KEVIN SCOTT STANDS ON A BOULDER NEAR ORTING IN PIERCE COUNTY, A REMINDER OF A CENTURIES-OLD MUDFLOW FROM MOUNT RAINIER.", "edition": "Final"}
