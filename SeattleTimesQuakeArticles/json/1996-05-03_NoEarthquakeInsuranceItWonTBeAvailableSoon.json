Insurance companies are expected to impose a moratorium on new earthquake policies to limit their liability for damage from the aftershocks.     \"It's like buying fire insurance once the house is on fire,\" said Patricia Hillis, spokeswoman for Safeco  Insurance Co.      She said Safeco will put a 10-day freeze on new earthquake policies, and most other insurance companies are expected to do the same.     Allstate agent Vic Rabago said his company will not allow any new policies for a month.     Rabago said most of his customers don't have quake coverage. That is true statewide: An estimated 88 percent of residents don't have it.     Earthquake insurance has to be purchased separately from standard homeowner's insurance. It costs at least $100 a year for a $100,000 wood-frame home and comes with a steep, $10,000 deductible.     The annual premium for a $100,000 brick home, which is more prone to damage, can be as high as $900.     The high deductible reflects that it is catastrophic coverage, Hillis said. It is intended to pay for major damage rather than broken dishes or cracks in the foundation.     \"A lot of people feel they don't want it or don't need it,\" Hillis said. \"These things are kind of wake-up calls. We're going to be flooded with calls.\"      The Insurance Information Institute has three publications on earthquakes and other disasters:       \"Taking Inventory,\" which explains how to determine the value of the contents of your home; \"Settling Insurance Claims After a Disaster,\" which explains the claims process; and \"How to Survive a Catastrophe,\" a guide for small businesses.
