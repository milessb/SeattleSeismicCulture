Steve Cox, who survived the October quake in the Bay Area, got through yesterday's powerful quake even though the road in front of him disappeared and his car was swept down a mountainside.        ``I was in the San Francisco one. . . . This one felt much stronger,'' he said. ``The aftershocks were really quite strong as well.''        He said he was driving toward Baguio, a mountain resort 55 miles north of Manila, when the quake hit. He jumped out of his car before it went off the side of a mountain.        It took him the two hours to finish his journey on foot to Baguio, arriving just in time to watch the final moments of the collapse of the Hyatt Hotel.Caption:  PHOTOAP: A PASSER-BY IS DWARFED BY HUGE SLABS OF CONCRETE FROM THE BAGUIO PARK HOTEL.
