The state-run National Seismological Institute said the quake, measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale and powerful enough to cause severe damage, struck  Santander province.     Its epicenter was in the Cordillera Oriental Andean mountains, 25 miles southeast of the city of Bucaramanga, and it was felt across much of northern Colombia, the institute said.     It said the quake's potential for destruction was limited by the fact that it occurred 105 miles beneath the Earth's crust, too deep to cause any significant damage on the surface.     The quake was followed by an aftershock measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale, powerful enough to cause moderate damage in a populated area, the institute said.     In January, a quake measuring 6.2 ripped through Colombia's central coffee-growing region, killing more than 1,200 people, injuring more than 4,800 others and causing millions of dollars in damage.", "edition": "Final"}
