A total of $500,000 has been budgeted to operate the observatory in conjunction with existing facilities.         Participants in the project are the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys and the U.S. Geological Survey.         ``The establishment of the Alaska Volcano Observatory is the first major step toward reducing the risk posed by Cook Inlet's four active volcanoes,'' said Syun-Ichi Akasofu, director of the university's Geophysical Institute.         He said computer links will be established among scientists and laboratories in Alaska, Washington and California, with researchers from the institutions conducting joint field studies.         Akasofu said about half of the observatory's work will deal with earthquakes.         ``Prediction of the eruption of volcanoes is more advanced than prediction of earthquakes,'' he said.         Recent volcanic activity in Alaska included the 1986 eruption of the Augustine volcano, an island in Cook Inlet. The volcano dusted south-central Alaska with ash. In 1987, researchers installed devices on the volcano to help them learn of impending eruptions.", "edition": "First"}
