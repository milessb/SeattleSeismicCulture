Despite safety worries after the Los Angeles earthquake, concerns about boosting the gasoline tax by 2 cents a gallon proved stronger, said Senate Transportation Chairman Larry Vognild, D-Everett.  \"We are taking a calculated risk,\" he warned, by not passing the bill, which he said would die in his committee.    \"The issue is dead for this session,\" agreed House Transportation Chairwoman Ruth Fisher, D-Tacoma.    Both Vognild and Fisher said seismic safety should be considered when a comprehensive revenue package is put together next.    Vognild's plan would have raised $56 million a year for the next 12 years.     Under terms of Initiative 601, the increase would have required public approval this fall.    The transportation budget approved by the House on Saturday adds $3 million to the $7 million now allocated for strengthening freeway bridges and overpasses.     Without additional money, the state Department of Transportation figures it would take 20 years to complete the most pressing projects and 71 years to fix all bridges and overpasses.    The Transportation Department has requested a $250 million, 20-year program.     That figure does not include the Alaskan Way Viaduct, a double-decker commuter highway along the Seattle waterfront. The future of the road is being studied; a retrofit has been calculated at $250 million.", "edition": "Final"}
