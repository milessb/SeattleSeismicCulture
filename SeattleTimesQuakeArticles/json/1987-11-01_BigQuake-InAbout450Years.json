According to two scientists at Humboldt State University in California, Gary Carver and R.M. Burke, the temblor could strike the area in the next 450 to 650 years.        The scientists admit, however, that they can't predict the size of the quake. Some experts have said it could be as much as 10 times greater than the San Francisco earthquake of 1906.        Carver and Burke, in a report prepared for the recent annual meeting of the Geological Society of America here, base their prediction on a study of excavations along the Little Salmon fault near Eureka, Calif.        Their excavations showed that quakes occurred as recently as 400 years ago and may have been in the southern portion of the Cascadia subduction zone, which stretches 750 miles from Cape Mendocino, Calif., to just north of Vancouver Island.        Preliminary evidence indicates the fault has slipped as much as 12 feet and perhaps more in separate earthquakes at roughly 500-year intervals for the past several thousand years.        Geophysicists Thomas Heaton and Stephen Hartzell warned in the April issue of Science magazine that a large earthquake, perhaps greater than 9.5 on the Richter scale, could strike the area.", "edition": "Weekend"}
