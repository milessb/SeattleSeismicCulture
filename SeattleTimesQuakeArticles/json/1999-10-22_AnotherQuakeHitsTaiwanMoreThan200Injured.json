No deaths were reported.    The damage from the 6.4 magnitude quake was minor compared to the destruction caused by the powerful temblor that killed more than 2,300 in central Taiwan one month ago. The two quakes were unrelated, seismologists said.    Still, officials said today's quake was strong enough to seriously damage 16 homes and three schools near the epicenter northwest of Chiayi, a city with a population of 263,000 about 180 miles south of Taipei.    About 230 people were injured, the military said.    About 80 aftershocks followed today's tremor, including 5.1- and 6.0-magnitude shocks, the Central Weather Bureau said.    Chiayi has been hit by several strong quakes in the past century.    The island's main evening newspapers reported today that about 200 people were taken to hospitals. Most suffered only minor injuries, TVBS television reported.    Earthquake magnitude is a measure of the total energy released by an earthquake. An increase of one digit in the scale represents a tenfold increase in the strength of the quake.", "edition": "Second"}
