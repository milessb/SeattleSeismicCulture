Experts from the University of Washington plan to install the first seismic station atop the 14,411-foot volcano this week, weather permitting.    The instrument should help them determine where the earthquakes are centered, and that, in turn, should help them predict whether a quake has the potential to shake loose a chunk of the mountain, unleashing mudflows that could bury nearby towns.    The UW seismology lab already is linked to six seismic stations on the mountain and six more in the surrounding lowlands. By studying seismic signals when an earthquake hits, scientists can trace them back to their underground origins.    If the quakes' origins are deep, they're probably just signs of an old volcano settling under its own weight. But if they originate higher in the volcano, they could be signs that it is shifting and popping along veins of weakened rock, Malone said. In that case, even slight shaking might be enough to dislodge enough rock and ice to create a raging river of mud.    Geologists have charted dozens of such major mudflows over the past 10,000 years in valleys that are today populated by tens of thousands of people.    Some of the mudflows were triggered by volcanic eruptions, but others may have been triggered by small earthquakes or the movement of molten rock through the volcano, geologists say.", "edition": "Final"}
