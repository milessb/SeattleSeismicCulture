Residents turned first to their families and property and didn't have time to search for pets that ran away. The dogs were left to rely on survival instincts, officials with humane societies in Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties said.        ``They will run in packs and bring (larger) animals down,'' said Stacy Hill of the Humane Society of Santa Clara Valley.        Humane Society officials don't know exactly how many dogs are on the loose, but reports from mountain residents put the number at ``a couple of hundred,'' said Judy Cassada of the Santa Cruz Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.        The Humane Society has not confirmed residents' reports that dogs are feeding on deer.        ``We've heard from people who live up there who say there used to be many, many deer,'' Cassada said. ``We're making an assumption that (the dogs) are bringing them down.''        She added that hundreds of cats also are missing.        Humane Society officials in both counties have been receiving and shipping huge donations of pet food - including 13,000 pounds of cat food and dog food Wednesday.        Officials hope owners will use the food to lure their pets home.        The Santa Cruz County society also is planning to round up strays and find them temporary homes, Cassada said. The society will publish the pets' pictures in newspapers in the hope their owners will reclaim them.", "edition": "First"}
