Many experts now say intelligence officials overreacted, but the U.S. still has not given Russia a clean bill of health     WASHINGTON - A high-priority classified alert issued by the CIA on Aug. 18 quickly caught the eye of senior U.S. policymakers. The bulletin came from the government's Nuclear Test Intelligence Committee, an interagency scientific group, and said Russia probably had conducted a nuclear test two days earlier on an island near the Arctic Circle.    Officials at the National Security Council (NSC) swung into action, convening an interagency meeting two days later. The Russian ambassador was summoned to hear a strong complaint at the State Department, and the senior U.S. diplomat in Moscow issued a similar statement at the Foreign Ministry there.    Although the government kept the report secret, the NSC prepared a statement to be read in case of a leak, which said, \"We do have information that a seismic event with explosive characteristics occurred in the vicinity of the Russian nuclear-test range\" on the island of Novaya Zemlya. When the statement was eventually released on Aug. 27, it raised dark suspicions around the world that Moscow had challenged the nuclear-test-ban treaty.    There was only one problem: The CIA's report about the site of the \"event\" was wrong, according to various U.S. intelligence and defense officials, independent scientific experts and the British, Norwegian and French governments. The event occurred about 80 miles out to sea and, these officials and experts now say, was almost certainly an earthquake.    In the past two months, U.S. intelligence officials say, the CIA has scoured its overt and secret sources of intelligence near the test site and has found nothing to corroborate its initial report - no sign of unusual radioactivity, no record of telltale underwater blast sounds.    The Russian government has called the charges unfounded and disappointing. But the administration has not yet publicly given Moscow a clean bill of health, a circumstance that some U.S. officials and independent scientists claim is partly due to a lingering distrust of Russia's military operations in the vicinity of the test site and partly to the reluctance of the CIA and senior policymakers to acknowledge that they made a diplomatic and scientific goof.    \"I personally think it was an earthquake,\" Harold Smith, assistant to the secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, said Friday, adding that other scientists at the Pentagon share his belief that the initial CIA report was wrong. \"We now know that they would have been well advised to wait\" until they had more data and could reach an accurate conclusion, he said.    \"Not only was there a mistake made, but there was no effort to retract it,\" said Paul Richards, a seismologist at Columbia University who consults for the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and has written a forthcoming article for the journal Nature that criticizes Washington's handling of the event.    What makes the initial CIA report especially surprising is that the event was described from the outset as having occurred at sea by officials at an international monitoring center in Arlington, Va., which was created to collect, analyze and distribute data from a worldwide network of nuclear test sensors - the same network used by the CIA to provide its analysis in this case.", "edition": "Final"}
