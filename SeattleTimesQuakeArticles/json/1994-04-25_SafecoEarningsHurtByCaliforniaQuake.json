The profit for the period ended March 31 was $56 million, or 89 cents a share, down 26 percent from $75.4 million, or $1.20 a share, a year ago. The January quake shaved 88 cents a share off the profit, Safeco said. Sales rose 7 percent, to $904 million from $843 million.     The core profit - excluding investment gains - was 69 cents a share. The mean estimate of 15 analysts following the Seattle-based insurance and financial services company was 78 cents a share. But Dan Nelson, an analyst with Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle, had expected 60 to 65 cents.     \"Excluding the catastrophe, this looks like a good quarter,\" Nelson said.      Safeco reported personal auto and surety profits of $17.1 million and $3.6 million. Property/casualty experienced a $59.5 million underwriting loss. Insurance companies traditionally write policies at break-even or less, then profit from investing the premiums. Of the quake's $175 million in claims, Safeco's cost after reinsurance is expected to be $62.5 million.", "edition": "Second"}
