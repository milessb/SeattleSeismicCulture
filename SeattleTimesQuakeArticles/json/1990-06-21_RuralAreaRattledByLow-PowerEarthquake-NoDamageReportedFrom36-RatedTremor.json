The 9:49 p.m. quake was centered about a mile southeast of Deming, said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University of Washington seismology lab in Seattle.        Deming is about 15 miles northeast of Bellingham.        Residents of Everson, Deming and Nugents Corner reported feeling the temblor, she said.        It was one of 60 to 80 relatively minor quakes felt in northwest Washington this year, she added. ``There's no indication that anything larger is imminent.''        She said one quake reportedly caused $40,000 damage in a ceramics shop.        An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in a local area. Each number on the scale represents a tenfold increase in magnitude.        Jonientz-Trisler was unsure what could be read into the increased seismic activity this year.", "edition": "Final"}
