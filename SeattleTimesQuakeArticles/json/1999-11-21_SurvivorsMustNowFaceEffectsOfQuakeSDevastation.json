The death toll from the Nov. 12 quake increased by almost 100 since Friday and was expected to rise further as more bodies are reached from within the piles of shattered concrete.    \"A lot of families pulled out their dead themselves and have taken them away to bury them in villages where they were born,\" said Ahmet Cekic, a local official in Duzce.    More than 5,000 people were injured and 750 buildings destroyed in the 7.2-magnitude temblor that hit the northwestern town of Duzce, the government's crisis center said.    A strong aftershock rocked Duzce late Friday, terrifying the people of the region - tens of thousands of them homeless, living in tents or in the open despite the cold. Regional Gov. Nusret Miroglu said as many as 200,000 people were sleeping in the streets.    No deaths or injuries were reported.          The Duzce temblor came three months after an earthquake killed 17,000 people in the same region.    Authorities and foreign rescue teams ended the search for survivors by Friday, after hopes of finding anyone alive ended.    U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan visited the site of the first quake Friday, opening a tent city for homeless survivors.    A U.N. team is in the Duzce region to coordinate relief efforts.    The government already was struggling to house the homeless.", "edition": "Final"}
