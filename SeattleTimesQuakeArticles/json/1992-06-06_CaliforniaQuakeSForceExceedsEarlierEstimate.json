The April quake and its aftershocks injured 95 people and caused an estimated $61 million in damage, mostly in towns south of Eureka, about 225 miles northwest of San Francisco.    The upgraded 7.1 magnitude of the main quake means it was just as strong as the Oct. 17, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay region. That quake - centered closer to heavily populated areas - killed more than 60 people, injured more than 3,700 and caused $5.9 billion in damage.    The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude; a 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than a 6.5. A 7 reading is a \"major\" quake capable of widespread heavy damage.", "edition": "First"}
