In a nationally televised news conference last night, a haggard-looking Duarte announced the new death toll _ many times over the figure of 100 he gave Saturday.     He said 10,000 people were injured and that hospitals were desperately short of medicine. The United States has sent $330,200 worth of blankets, tents and various supplies, in addition to the approximately $1.3 million a day it sends in military and other official, non-emergency aid.     The government estimates that about 300,000 people, many of whom had been living in shacks, lost their homes and another 100,000 were left jobless when the quake shut down or destroyed businesses.     Some 500,000 Salvadorans already have been displaced by the country's 7-year-old civil war between government troops and guerrillas.     ``We are practically going to have to reconstruct all of the city,'' Duarte said.     U.S. officials say the U.S. Embassy, closed after the quake, may be damaged beyond repair.     The intensity of Friday's 30-second quake measured between 5.4 and 7 on the Richter scale.     About 60 percent of the city's water system was destroyed, leaving hundreds of thousands of residents scrambling for something to drink.     Meanwhile, rescuers picked their way through the rubble with the aid of specially trained dog teams brought in from the United States, Switzerland and France. Yesterday, the rescuers dug more than 70 survivors from the wreckage of buildings.     Today, leaders of rescue squads conceded they were nearing the end of efforts to find more survivors. However, others noted that some people were saved after being trapped for a week in last year's great quake in Mexico City.     Monsignor Arturo Rivera y Damas, Roman Catholic archbishop of San Salvador, held Mass in the plaza across from the Metropolitan Cathedral, closed because of quake damage.     He expressed hope that the disaster might encourage the guerrillas and the government to end the war. On Saturday, the rebels announced a unilateral temporary cease-fire, but Duarte, calling them terrorists, refused the offer.
