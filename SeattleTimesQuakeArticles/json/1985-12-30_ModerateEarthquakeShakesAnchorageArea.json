Tom Sokolowski, head of the center, said the earthquake measured 5.2 on the Richter scale of ground motion. He said the quake was centered about 20 miles northwest of Anchorage and occurred at 3:41 a.m.        The earthquake was felt strongly in the Anchorage, Palmer and Wassila area, Sokolowski said.        ``It probably woke up a lot of people. It woke me up without even my alarms,'' he said.        Sokolowski said the earthquake was too far inland to pose a danger of a tsunami, or earthquake-caused tidal wave.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.        An earthquake of 3.5 can cause slight damage in a local area, 4 can cause moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 can be severe. A 7 reading is a ``major'' quake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.        The 1964 Alaska quake which killed 131 people measured 8.4 on the Richter scale, while the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 was estimated to register 8.3.", "edition": "Third"}
