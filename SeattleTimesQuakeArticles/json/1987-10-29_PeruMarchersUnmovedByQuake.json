No damage or injuries were reported from the quake, and there was no alarm among the more than 200,000 worshipers in the Our Lord of the Miracles procession.        The temblor was centered about 160 miles southeast of Lima, according to the Geophysical Institute of Peru.        It could be felt along a 180-mile section of Peru's Pacific coast and in Lima. Much of the nation lies over an earthquake zone and is frequently hit by quakes, many of which are strong enough to be felt but very few of which cause serious damage.        The marchers prayed for protection from disasters and for miracles, believing that requests to God are answered during the holiday.", "edition": "First"}
