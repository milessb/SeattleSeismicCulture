The midmorning quake was centered 30 miles underground in northern Ibaraki prefecture, or state, 80 miles northeast of Tokyo, the Meteorological Agency said.    A woman, 61, suffered minor injuries after being hit on the head by a vase that fell from a shelf in her house, said Ibaraki Prefectural police official Takao Iida.    The temblor caused a Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute testing reactor in the town of Oarai to shut down, said Masayuki Toda, a spokesman for the institute.    The reactor is designed to automatically stop operating during earthquakes, and no radioactivity was released, Toda said.    There was no danger of a tsunami, a quake-triggered wave, the Meteorological Agency said.    Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations.", "edition": "Final"}
