None of the roughly 400 workers on site were injured, but a portion of Occidental Avenue South was closed because 6-7 tons of a vertical form of rebar hung horizontally from the side of the stadium. Workers used cranes to clear the loose scaffolding and debris, and the street is expected to be open today. But no one knows when construction crews will resume working on the $430 million Washington State Football/Soccer stadium that is being built with $300 million of public money and additional funding from Seahawk owner Paul Allen. \"They shut down the job site and sent workers home immediately,\" said Pete Pedersen, a spokesperson for the stadium project. \"At a cursory glance, everything looks to be OK. \"During the walk around, they didn't see anything out of the ordinary, but again, it's early. They're going to continue through (today) and take as long as they need to. I suspect it will take a few days, at least, and, pending any significant findings, (construction crews) should be back to work next week.\" If the stadium has not suffered significant damage, meeting the 2002 deadline should not be a problem. Pedersen said the stadium is scheduled to be 50 percent complete in two  weeks.", "edition": "Fourth"}
