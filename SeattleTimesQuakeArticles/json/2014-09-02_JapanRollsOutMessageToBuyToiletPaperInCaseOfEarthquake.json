The government and paper companies kicked off a \u201cLet\u2019s stockpile toilet paper!\u201d campaign to mark Disaster Prevention Day, warning of a possible crisis because nearly half of the supply comes from one of Japan\u2019s most earthquake-prone areas.  Officials said people immediately think of food and water as emergency supplies but easily forget toilet paper, and get desperate when it\u2019s too late.  \u201cAfter running out of toilet paper, people start using tissue, and that could clog up precious workable toilets,\u201d said Toshiyuki Hashimoto, an industry-ministry official in charge of paper products.  As part of the campaign, makers are offering a tightly rolled, 490-foot-long, single-layer toilet paper that lasts more than twice as long as a regular roll.  A family of four should be able to survive for a month on a six-roll pack, priced at $4.40 and with a five-year expiration date, said Satoshi Kurosaki, chairman of the Japan Household Paper Industry Association.  Government and industry officials said 41 percent of the country\u2019s toilet-paper supply comes from Shizuoka prefecture in central Japan, where experts say there is a higher than 80 percent chance of a major offshore quake in the next 30 years.  Officials warned of a nationwide toilet-paper shortage for about a month in such a disaster, based on lessons learned from the deadly March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in northern Japan.  Nine months after that disaster, toilet paper was added to a list of recommended items that included food, water, portable toilets and a first-aid kit, under the government\u2019s Basic Disaster Management Plan.  \u201cAlong with food, toilet paper was among the first items that disappeared from store shelves during the disaster, even outside disaster-hit areas,\u201d Hashimoto said in front of a public display in the ministry entrance hall,   decorated with campaign posters, including one saying \u201cBe prepared and no regrets!\u201d  The campaign involves nearly 40 toilet-paper companies.  \u201cToilet paper is an indispensable part of daily life,\u201d Kurosaki said. \u201cAnd yet 41\u2009percent of the supply comes from the extremely high-risk zone.  \u201cSo we should be prepared.\u201d", "edition": "Unknown"}
