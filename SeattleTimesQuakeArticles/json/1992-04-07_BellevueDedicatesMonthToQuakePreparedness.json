Last night, though, the City Council decided to change it to a month.     \"The month will be used to highlight ways in which the public can become familiar with ways to better prepare themselves in the event of a major earthquake in the Puget Sound region,\" said Bellevue Fire Department Lt. Bob Hays.     Redmond, too, has declared April \"Earthquake Awareness\" month.     Both fire departments will hold seminars and activities on surviving earthquakes on Saturday, April 25 at the Crossroads shopping center.", "edition": "Final"}
