The floors and walls really shook. . . . It was pretty scary,'' teacher Steve Bruland said of yesterday's tremor, which measured 4.0 on the Richter scale.         Cans toppled from the shelves of a grocery store next door, Bruland said.         The quake hit at 1:41 p.m. and was centered 4.2 miles east of Mount Verson near Clear Lake, said Ruth Ludwin, a research scientist in the University of Washington geophysics program.         An earthquake measuring 4.0 is capable of moderate damage. Bruland said plaster fell and small cracks developed in walls of Big Lake Elementary.", "edition": "Third"}
