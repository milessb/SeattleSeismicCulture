The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was centered five miles southeast of Ocotillo in Imperial County \u2014 about 85 miles east of San Diego. It struck Monday at 9:26 p.m. PDT. San Diego County Office of Emergency Services made a round of calls to all cities in the county and found no reports of significant damage. Louis Fuentes, chairman of the Imperial County board of supervisors, said he had no immediate reports of damage. The quake was an aftershock of the deadly Easter Sunday magnitude-7.2 quake that shook Baja California and Southern California, said Egill Hauksson, a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He said the epicenter of Monday's quake occurred in the same zone of the quake in April. \"Aftershocks can go on for months and years,\" he said. Thousands of aftershocks have occurred since the Easter earthquake. At least 45 aftershocks were recorded immediately following Monday's 5.7 quake, with the largest measuring at magnitude-4.5. A 5.7-magnitude earthquake \"could break windows, it could throw things on the floor, it could create cracks on the wall, but we don't expect things to collapse,\" Hauksson said. The quake was felt as a gentle rolling motion in the Los Angeles area. San Diego's Petco Park swayed during the quake, causing a momentary pause at the Toronto Blue Jays-San Diego Padres game. The public-address announcer asked that everyone remain calm. The crowd cheered.", "edition": "Fourth"}
