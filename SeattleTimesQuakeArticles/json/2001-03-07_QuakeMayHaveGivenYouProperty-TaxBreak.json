State law provides for relief on 2001 taxes for damaged property and for property that suffered no damage but dropped by 20 percent or more in value as a result of the quake. Affected property owners can phone the Assessor's Office at 206-296-3920 or 206-296-5151 and ask for a form called the Taxpayer's Claim for Reduction of Assessment on Destroyed Property. The form can be downloaded fromwww.metrokc.gov/assessor/. Taxpayers have three years to apply for relief. The dollar value of any damage must be established by an appraiser from the Assessor's Office.", "edition": "Fourth"}
