Officials said the death toll was likely to rise as rescuers made their way through the debris. Firefighters aided by dogs were trying to rescue people from crumbled homes, including a student dorm where half a dozen students were trapped, RAI state TV reported. The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude of the quake was 6.3, though Italy's National Institute of Geophysics put it at 5.8. The temblor struck 70 miles northeast of Rome, with the epicenter near the city of L'Aquila, in the mountainous Abruzzo region. By early today, the death toll stood at 20, including five children, with some 30 people unaccounted for, the ANSA news agency reported.
