The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.8, struck at 2:20 p.m. and was centered beneath Lake Tanganyika on the Congo-Tanzania border, about 600 miles southwest of Nairobi, Kenya, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said on its Web site. \"Dozens of houses have collapsed; several children were buried by the roofs of their houses,\" said Dr. Jean-Donne Owali, a Congolese humanitarian worker in the lakeside city of Kalemie, Congo, about 35 miles from the epicenter. Owali said at least two people had died at his clinic. He said he saw children bleeding from head injuries after their mud-and-thatch homes collapsed. United Nations spokesman Michel Bonnardeaux said a child was killed when two houses and a church \"crumbled.\" Three people were wounded. It was not clear if the child was one of the two people Owali reported killed. Bonnardeaux said most injuries in the area were from falling zinc-and-steel roofs. The poor region also has camps for tens of thousands of refugees from wars and economic collapse in Congo and Burundi. The quake sent people running from buildings in Kigoma, the main Tanzanian transport hub on the shores of Lake Tanganyika about 90 miles from the epicenter, said regional commissioner Elmon Mahawa. Authorities were waiting for police stations in remote parts of the country to report on any casualties. The USGS said the quake was about six miles underground and shook Nairobi and the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa. The temblor was also felt on the shores of Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake, and in Tanzanian towns bordering Zambia and Malawi, Tanzania's meteorological chief Mohamed Mhita said by phone from the commercial capital of Dar es Salaam.Caption:  mapThe Associated Press: 6.8-magnitude earthquake (GI1104POE)", "edition": "Fourth"}
