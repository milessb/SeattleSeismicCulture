The Napa-Sonoma area is home to one of California\u2019s best-known wine-growing regions. Napa County has 789 licensed wineries, which had sales of $5.5\u2009billion in 2011, according to the Napa Valley Vintners Association, a trade group.  \u201cIt was a significant earthquake,\u201d City Manager Mike Parness said in an interview. \u201cGiven the magnitude and the reports of damage, this is going to take some time to get back from.\u201d  Insurers will probably cover about $2.1\u2009billion, according to an estimate from Kinetic Analysis Corp., which projected total losses of about twice that sum. Many homeowners don\u2019t have earthquake coverage, according to the Insurance Information Institute.  In California, where most of the costliest U.S. earthquakes have occurred, just 12 percent of residents are protected against that risk, which is excluded from a standard homeowners\u2019 policy, according to III, an industry group. The figure is about half that in the Napa area, said Robert Hartwig, president  of the Insurance Information Institute.  \u201cThe main source of claims could well be commercial claims, those coming from wineries and vineyards and other commercial interests,\u201d Hartwig said.  The temblor, the strongest in Northern California in 25 years, hit the Napa region north of San Francisco at about 3:20 a.m. Sunday, crumpling historic buildings, cracking roads and injuring more than 120 people. The quake left many in the region without power and water, and California Gov.  Jerry Brown declared the zone a disaster area.  At least 65 aftershocks have rattled Napa and its surrounding areas since the quake,  according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  In Napa, debris and broken glass littered sidewalks in front of restaurants, wine stores and antique shops. The city updated the number of buildings \u201cred-tagged\u201d as being uninhabitable to 33, including the Napa Senior Center. PG&E utility crews checked about 100 reports of gas leaks and odor and reported determined there are no more leaks, the city said on its website late Monday.  Napa also issued a boil-water advisory, which will be rescinded once all the 60 water lines are repaired and water service has been tested and restored.  Sunday\u2019s quake occurred on the West Napa fault. It\u2019s about 20 miles, much shorter than the better-known Hayward and Rodgers Creek faults, which are capable of a 7.2-magnitude quake. Still, it produced the largest earthquake in the Bay Area since the deadly 6.9 Loma Prieta quake in 1989.  Sunday\u2019s shaking was dwarfed in magnitude and sheer destruction by that much larger earthquake, as well as 1971 and 1994 San Fernando Valley temblors.  But considering that Sunday\u2019s earthquake ran less than half the length of the fault, scientists said it could have been worse.  \u201cThis is one of the smaller of the sets of faults in the East Bay, but it\u2019s still obviously large enough to create a magnitude-6 quake, and it didn\u2019t rupture the length of the whole fault,\u201d said Jeane Hardebeck, a USGS seismologist in Menlo Park, Calif. \u201cIf it had, you could imagine a much larger earthquake.\u201d  Like a lot of faults, she said, it runs parallel to the roughly 800-mile-long San Andreas fault. Sunday\u2019s quake happened just south of Napa and ran north along the fault, which runs through the western side of the Napa Valley, Hardebeck said.Caption:  Damaged wine barrels stand outside Napa Barrel Care on Monday. Experts say Sunday\u2019s quake ruptured along only part of  a local geological fault and could have been worse. Eric Risberg / The Associated Press", "edition": "Unknown"}
