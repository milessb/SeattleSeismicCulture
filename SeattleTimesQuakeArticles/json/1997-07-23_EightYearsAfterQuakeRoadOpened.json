The five-mile roadway, now the most expensive freeway in the nation, opened in time to relieve the crowded morning commute to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Motorists no longer have to drive through Oakland streets to reach the span.    More than 118,000 cars are expected to use the freeway every day.    Caltrans said the expensive price tag - nearly double the original estimate - was partly the result of having to buy more property and clean up polluted soil. The route, which links Interstate 880 and Interstate 80, is three times longer than the original link, because local residents demanded that the roadway be moved out of their neighborhood.    Money for the project came from $1.3 billion in congressional funding earmarked to repair  roads damaged in the 1989 earthquake.", "edition": "Final"}
