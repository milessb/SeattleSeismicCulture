In Germany, a 79-year-old woman was reported dead of a heart attack.    Preliminary readings put the quake, a relative rarity in the region,  at 5.5 to 5.8 on the Richter scale. The epicenter  was near the Dutch town of Roermond, close to the German border, according to the Royal Dutch Weather Institute. The temblor was felt hundreds of miles away in Brussels, throughout much of Germany and in parts of France.         Police in Germany said 31 people were injured, while 15 were reported hurt in the Netherlands, most after running in the street and being hit by bricks and roof tiles.     Light damage to buildings was reported in at least five major German cities, mostly along the Rhine River valley. Water mains were disrupted and cars damaged by falling debris.Caption:  MAPAP: EARTHQUAKE (MAP NOT AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY)", "edition": "Final"}
