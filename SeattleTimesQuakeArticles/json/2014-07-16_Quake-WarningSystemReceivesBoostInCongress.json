Its prospects remain shaky, however.  Election-year fights over other issues could keep Congress from completing work on its spending bills.  Still, the warning system enjoys bipartisan support.  \u201cIt\u2019s critical that the West Coast implement an earthquake early-warning system that will give us a heads up before the \u2018big one\u2019 hits, so we can save lives and protect infrastructure,\u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who led a group of West Coast lawmakers in seeking the funding.  The money was included in a spending bill sent to the House by its appropriations committee. The Senate has yet to act on its version of the bill to fund the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and other agencies for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., did include language in a Senate Appropriations Committee report that would direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to give priority to early-warning systems when it considers grant-funding requests.  It will cost a projected $38.3 million to build the system on the West Coast and $16.1 million a year to operate and maintain it.  Schiff said the $5 million would allow for purchase and installation of additional sensors and hiring of staff.  \u201cThis is great news for the West Coast,\u201d said Richard Allen. director of the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Seismological Laboratory. \u201cOur demonstration system currently alerts a few test users of earthquakes. This funding will start us on the path to a public system that will benefit everyone.\u201d  The project received a boost by the ascent last fall of Rep. Ken Calvert, a Republican from earthquake country \u2014 the Inland Empire \u2014 to the chairmanship of the Interior appropriations subcommittee, which oversees funding for the USGS\u2019 earthquake programs.  The USGS and its university partners are testing a prototype system in the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas; the system delivers warnings to about 75 people.  Deploying a full system of sensors along the West Coast is expected to take about five years, according to scientists. It would detect waves radiating from the epicenter of a quake and notify people through phones, radio and TV.", "edition": "Unknown"}
