The report shows unreinforced, 16-inch-thick brick walls and clay tile walls inside the rotunda could buckle in an earthquake. The 106-foot-high Capitol dome and the 8 1/2-ton golden pioneer statue atop it could collapse.        Other areas of the 275,000-square-foot Capitol, built from 1935 to 1938, appear to be safer thanks to concrete reinforced pillars.        The preliminary report was prepared by R.T. Miller Engineering Inc., a Portland consulting structural engineering firm.        Raymond Miller, head of the firm, said Friday that the ``immediacy of the problem is as near as the next earthquake.''        The danger of collapse of the rotunda is of particular concern because the area at the front entrance of the Capitol is visited daily by hundreds of adults and schoolchildren.", "edition": "Third"}
