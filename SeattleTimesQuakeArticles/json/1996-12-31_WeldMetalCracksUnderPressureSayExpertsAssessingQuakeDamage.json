It has been banned in future construction in Los Angeles, but the Los Angeles Times said today that it remains in use elsewhere in California and throughout the earthquake-prone West.    For more than 20 years, builders have used the weld metal, known as \"120\" or \"E70T-4,\" with confidence. But laboratory tests show the metal fractures at stress levels far below what would be expected.    The metal, used to weld together many of the steel structures damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, is distributed by Cleveland-based Lincoln Electric.    St. John's Medical Plaza in Santa Monica is suing Lincoln for more than $10 million, alleging that metal used to seal welds in the building is defective and left the structure vulnerable in the Northridge quake. Lincoln officials claim E70T-4 performed reliably when used properly.    Researchers at Lehigh University and the University of Texas at Austin confirmed in tests that the metal fractures under less stress than expected.    Researchers continue to examine the role played by factors other than the weld metal itself, but tests show that not even ideal construction conditions can overcome the metal's inherent vulnerability.", "edition": "Final"}
