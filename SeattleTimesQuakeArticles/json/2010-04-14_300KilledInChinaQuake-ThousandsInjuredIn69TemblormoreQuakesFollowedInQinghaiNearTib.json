The U.S. Geological Survey said a magnitude 6.9 temblor struck southern Qinghai, near Tibet, and was followed by aftershocks. The quakes toppled houses, an elementary school, part of a Buddhist tower in a public park and seriously damaged the main hospital in town, the Chinese media reported. The quake hit the county of Yushu, a Tibetan area in Qinghai's south, said the China Earthquake Networks Center, which measured the quake's magnitude at 7.1. A local government Web site put the county's population in 2005 at 89,300, a community of mostly herders and farmers. State broadcaster CCTV said the death toll had risen to about 300, with an additional 8,000 people injured. The China Earthquake Administration said phone lines were down, hindering rescue efforts, while workers were racing to release water from a reservoir where a crack had formed after the quake. In Jiegu, a township near the epicenter, more than 85 percent of houses had collapsed, while large cracks have appeared on buildings still standing, the official Xinhua news agency cited Zhuohuaxia, a local publicity official, as saying. There were also students buried under the debris of a collapsed vocational school.", "edition": "Fourth"}
