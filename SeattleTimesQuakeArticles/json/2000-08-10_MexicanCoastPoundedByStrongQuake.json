The quake's lone apparent casualty was a man recovering from a heart operation who died - possibly of fright - in the town of Huetamo, 100 miles northeast of  Lazaro Cardenas, Nahum Cortes of the state civil-defense agency said.     The 6:42 a.m. quake's offshore epicenter was 30 miles from Lazaro Cardenas, a port about 210 miles southwest of Mexico City. The quake, which toppled bookshelves and scatted goods from supermarket shelves in Lazaro Cardenas,   was followed by two aftershocks.     It swayed buildings in Mexico City and led officials to close the capital's airport briefly,  but no significant damage was reported.     Mexico's National Seismological Service calculated the magnitude at 7. The U.S. Geological Survey put it at 6.4. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.     Mexico's most deadly quakes strike the Pacific coast. Among those was the 8.1-magnitude 1985 quake that killed thousands in Mexico  City.Caption:  MAPThe Associated Press: Mexico (map not available electronically)", "edition": "First"}
