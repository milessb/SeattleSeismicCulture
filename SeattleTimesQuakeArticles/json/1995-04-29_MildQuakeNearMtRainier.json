The temblor struck at 11:34 a.m. and was centered near Packwood, about 25 miles south of Mount Rainier in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, said Pat Jorgenson, spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey's regional office in Menlo Park, Calif.    It was a crustal earthquake about 10 miles below the earth's surface, said Bill Steele, a seismologist at the University of Washington geophysics program in Seattle.    The quake registered only 2.5 in magnitude - quakes measuring between 2 and 3 are considered the smallest that can be felt.    The quake followed an even smaller shock about two hours earlier in the Mount St. Helens seismic zone in southwest Washington, Steele said", "edition": "Final"}
