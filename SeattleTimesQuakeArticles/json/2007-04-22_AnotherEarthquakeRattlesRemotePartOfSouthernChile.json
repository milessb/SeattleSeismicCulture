The government's Emergency Bureau said preliminary reports indicate there were no injuries or major damage in the sparsely populated area located in the Aysen Fjord, about 1,700 miles south of Santiago. The quake struck at 1:53 p.m. with a magnitude of 6.2, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Hundreds of tremors have shaken the area since January. Officials say they are probably related to the eventual birth of a volcano in the fjord.", "edition": "Fourth"}
