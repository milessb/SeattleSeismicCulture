The tremor was centered about 130 miles west of Adak and was reported felt on Adak.    Earthquake monitors with the USGS in Golden, Colo., said their early seismograph readings indicated the tremor at a magnitude of 5.4 on the Richter scale. It occurred at 4:14 a.m. Alaska time.    The USGS said it did not receive any immediate reports of damage. Earthquakes are common in Alaska's Aleutian Islands.    The Richter scale is a measure of the strength of an earthquake as recorded by the ground motion. Each increase of one whole number indicates a 10-fold increase in the strength of the quake.      The great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter scale. An earthquake with a magnitude between 6 and 7 can cause severe damage.", "edition": "Final"}
