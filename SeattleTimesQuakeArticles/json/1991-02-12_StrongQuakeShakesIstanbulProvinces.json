There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the temblor, which was also felt in the western provinces of Bursa, Kutahya and Bilecik.        Kandilli Observatory said the earthquake measured 4.8 on the Richter scale. Its epicenter was in the Marmara sea, about 16 miles from Istanbul, the observatory said without giving the precise direction.        People were seen rushing outside as the tremor hit Istanbul at 11:50 a.m., rocking buildings.        The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times greater.", "edition": "Final"}
