There were sighs of relief when the earth failed to shake at 8 p.m., (8:30 a.m. PDT), the hour the astrologer identified by the Iranian news agency IRNA as Sung Chi Bi had forecast.      But as dusk fell on the city of 7 million, many of those camping out said they would stay a few more hours just to be on the safe side.      Thousands more had left the capital, taking advantage of the two-day holiday yesterday and today.      The scare began Friday when Tehran Radio relayed the forecast, apparently first broadcast on Beijing radio's Farsi program.      Tehran Radio repeatedly read statements by seismologists saying the forecast had no scientific basis. Scientists say Tehran, crisscrossed by a dozen fault lines, is likely to be hit by a strong tremor but it is impossible to predict the time.      The scare was reinforced by grim memories of Iran's deadliest earthquake, which killed 35,000 people in the Caspian coast province of Gilan and neighboring Zanjan northwest of Tehran in June 1990.      Since 1910, earthquakes have killed about 95,000 Iranians.", "edition": "Final"}
