The state will spend $1 million to install seismic restrainers on 11 bridges along Interstate 5, Highway 99 and Highway 2, DOT spokesman Brent Olson said.     The bridges will remain open to traffic during the work, but motorists may have to stop occasionally. The work should be completed by fall.     The bridges in South Snohomish County are:      --  The 228th Street Southwest bridge over I-5.     --  The Maple Road bridge over I-5.     --  The bridge over I-5 that leads to the westbound Highway 526 ramp.     --  The bridge over I-5 on the ramp from northbound Highway 99 to northbound I-5.     Four bridges along Highway 9 near Snohomish also will be bolstered: the bridge near the north end of Harvey Field, the Snohomish River bridge, the Riverview Road bridge and the 72nd Street Southeast bridge.     The other three bridges are on Highway 2 at Proctor, No Name and Anderson creeks between Gold Bar and Index.", "edition": "Final"}
