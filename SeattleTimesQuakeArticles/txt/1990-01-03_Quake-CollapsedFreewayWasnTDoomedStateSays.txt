SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Engineering tests on a still-standing segment of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland have confirmed that a relatively simple strengthening of a mile-long elevated section could have prevented its collapse in the Oct. 17 earthquake, California Department of Transportation officials say        The technique, which involves attaching steel reinforcement to the double-decked structure's concrete columns, never was applied to the Nimitz section of Interstate 880 because engineers considered the structure one of the safest in the state until the 7.1-magnitude earthquake turned it into a stack of concrete pancakes, killing 42 people.        But now, engineers are preparing plans to use the retrofit technique on five San Francisco freeway segments similar to the Nimitz that remain closed because of fears that they, too, might collapse in a major quake.           In October, officials said repeatedly that any such retrofit was expected to take years to evolve.        That assertion was disputed by engineers in the private sector and at universities. After the quake prompted state officials to provide more money for research, professors at the University of California, Berkeley, applied existing technology developed by the state transportation department to confirm that the structure could have been saved.        Three retrofit plans were designed to strengthen the joints connecting the upper and lower portions of the concrete columns. Engineers agree that the joints were the weak link that caused the columns to break apart and fall, leaving no support for the massive upper road deck, which fell upon the lower lanes.        In the testing, engineers attached steel bars, plates and beams to the columns and then subjected the structure to the kind of vibrations and movement that could be expected in a major quake. They used hydraulic jacks to apply more than 4 million pounds of lateral force to the structure, moving it more than 10 inches.        ``The structure did suffer some cracking but did not collapse under the extreme forces,'' James Roberts, chief of the Department of Transportation's structures division, said yesterday in a prepared statement.
