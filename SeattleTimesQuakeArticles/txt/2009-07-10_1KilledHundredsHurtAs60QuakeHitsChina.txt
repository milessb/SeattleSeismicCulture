BEIJING â€” A moderate earthquake rocked southwest China, killing one person, injuring at least 324 others and collapsing some 18,000 homes, state media said. The magnitude-6.0 temblor, centered in Yunnan province's Yao'an county, also damaged nearly 40,000 homes Thursday, the Xinhua news agency said. Thirty people suffered severe injuries, Xinhua said. The quake was followed by eight aftershocks, and the provincial civil-affairs department was sending 4,500 tents, 3,000 quilts and other relief materials to Yao'an, Xinhua said. Hundreds of police were dispatched, it said. Yunnan is a quake-prone, mountainous region on China's southern border with Thailand and Myanmar. It also borders Sichuan province, where a magnitude-7.9 quake last year killed almost 90,000 people.
