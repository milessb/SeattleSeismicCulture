ANCHORAGE, Alaska     The earthquake that rattled Alaska this week shook loose several huge avalanches that rolled toward mountain climbers camped at the 7,000-foot level of Mount McKinley.     Bill Mattison, 33, of Vail, Colo, was in a tent at the main base camp on Kahiltna Glacier when the quake hit Tuesday night.     "Then all of a sudden we saw a 500-foot wall of snow coming at us," he said. "There was nothing we could do. There was just this incredible wall of ice dust . . .     "We thought for sure we were going to be buried. We thought it was the end."     Mattison was among 123 climbers on the 20,320-foot mountain. He believes it was a miracle no one was killed or injured.      The avalanche stopped just short of the camp.
