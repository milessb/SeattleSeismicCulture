ANCHORAGE      A moderate earthquake jolted Anchorage yesterday, causing kitchen cabinet doors to fly open and knocking furniture around. There were no immediate reports of injury or damage.     The quake hit at 9:03 a.m. and registered 5.4 on the Richter scale, a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said.     Guy Urban, a geophysicist at the warning center, said the quake was felt strongly around Anchorage, the state's most populous region with 235,000 residents.     Linda Mazique said she thought at first the rolling she felt was wind. A strong storm with winds to 90 mph rocked Anchorage overnight, but had largely subsided by yesterday.
