BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) _ A gold-laced Christmas tree stands near Manger Square, and a young Palestinian dresses as Santa Claus to attract restaurant customers, but this Christmas season the tourists, scared by terrorist violence, are going elsewhere        The number of pilgrims in the Holy Land is down about 20 percent this season because of terror attacks, Haya Fisher of the Israeli Tourism Ministry's pilgrimage division said yesterday.        Several airplanes and the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro have been hijacked this year in the Middle East. Seventeen Israelis have been killed in attacks in and near the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River, and in response, the Israelis have increased security.        Police have blocked a main road leading to the square with metal barricades, and military jeeps cruised the city.        Fisher attributed much of the decrease to Americans who decided not to come. ``People, especially Americans, are deterred by all this violence,'' she said.        Ella May Lower of Eureka, Calif., one American who decided to come anyway, said: ``It's surprising to see soldiers all over the place. It's hard to believe there are things going on that hurt people.''        Standing near the towering Christmas tree next to Manger Square's police station, Wanda Vogel of Dot Lake, Alaska, said her family tried to talk her out of traveling. ``I just told them that God goes wherever I go, and I'm going,'' she said.        Wahel Muammar, a 17-year-old Palestinian, put on a plastic Santa Claus outfit and rang a small brass bell, trying to attract customers to his friend's empty hamburger restaurant near Manger Square.        ``I'm trying to catch them on their way out of church, but there aren't very many people around this year,'' Muammar said through his thick beard of white cotton.        His friend, 27-year-old Palestinian Lawrence Hanania, blamed the business slump on the Arab-Israeli conflict. ``I wish people felt that the city where Jesus was born is peaceful, but we have too many political problems here,'' he said.        In the winding, narrow streets off Manger Square, dozens of tourists patronized shops and businesses. But at this same time last year, their numbers were in the hundreds.        Some tourists who did visit Bethlehem went directly to the Church of the Nativity, the site where tradition says Jesus was born. But they returned to Jerusalem without stopping to shop.Caption:  PHOTOUPI / REUTERS: AN ISRAELI SOLDIER IN BETHLEHEM YESTERDAY GUARDS MANGER SQUARE AND THE CHURCH OF THE NATIVITY, WHERE MIDNIGHT MASS WILL BE SAID CHRISTMAS EVE.
