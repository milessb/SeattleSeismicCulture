Seventy-year-old St. Mark's Cathedral on Capitol Hill came through the earthquake in good condition, but its world-famous Flentrop organ was extensively damaged. "Only about a quarter to a third of the organ is usable," said Mel Butler, canon organist and choirmaster for the Episcopal cathedral. The organ was bolted to the wall, but that's what ended up causing a lot of the damage, said Jeff Wilson, a spokesman for the church. "It ripped away from the bolts and slammed back into the wall several times." Many pipes were crushed; several sections of the organ have been removed so they wouldn't crush other sections. Repairs are expected to cost between $150,000 and $250,000, and the instrument probably won't be played at full capacity until fall, said Butler. Until then, it will be used occasionally for church services, he said. The 36-year-old organ, the largest of its kind on the West Coast, has 4,000 pipes and stands about 50 feet tall.
