When our little boys used to play together, I knew her as Aida Shanafelt. Later, she was Aida Ludwig. But when the exotic Armenian-community spokeswoman was introduced on a recent local television broadcast, she was Kouyoumjian, which I remembered as the name of her late mother         It was time to renew an old friendship. Aida Kouyoumjian and I drank tea while one of her sons, Brian, set tile on the hearth of her newly remodeled living room on Mercer Island.         ``I feel like Aida again!'' she proclaimed, her dark eyes dancing. ``I love being Aida Kouyoumjian.''         After her divorce from Tunney Ludwig became final last year, Aida plunged into ethnic activities, becoming president of the Armenian Cultural Association and joining the Armenian Church of Seattle, a group that meets once a month to worship in the traditional way: with an hour of chanting, and the scripture read in Armenian by a priest from Los Angeles, replete with robes and miter.         More recently, she has plunged full-bore into organizing relief for victims of the devastating earthquake in Soviet Armenia, working through the church and with a variety of Eastside and Seattle groups.         Aida's life sounds like a tale from the Arabian Nights, and she tells it like a latter-day Scheherazade.         ``I owe my life to 14 dollars and 50 cents,'' she declared, recalling her story while sipping tea. ``In 1914 my mother, Mannig, was one of the children driven into trackless desert by the Ottoman Turks, who had massacred the parents.''         Mannig, about 5, and a sister were the only survivors of a large and prosperous family that had lived near Istanbul. The girls were among about 2,000 refugees who wound up in orphanages in Baghdad, in the easterly end of the Ottoman Empire that became Iraq.         Mannig's orphanage frequently was visited by one of its benefactors, a wealthy Armenian businessman in his early 30s. Mardiros Kouyoumjian ``was taken with mother,'' said Aida. When Mannig, by then 15, was slated for transfer to Jerusalem, Mardiros proposed.         ``Mother had not yet attended school, and she wanted an education very much,'' said Aida. ``But my father said, `After we are married, I will bring a school to you.' Then, she said she didn't want to be separated from her sister. `We will find a husband for your sister,' he declared.''         True to his word, Aida's father found a bachelor for her aunt and the two men were married to the sisters by the captain of a ship headed for Jerusalem.         ``When the vessel landed, the rest of the children headed for an Armenian bishop's orphanage, while the newlyweds got into dad's limousine and drove back to his mansion in Baghdad,'' Aida said. ``Again, Mannig was rich. Her husband brought teachers to their home for French, English, piano, whatever she wanted. She was mistress of the mansion and entertained extensively, including royalty and members of the diplomatic corps.''         In this atmosphere Aida, oldest of the three children of Mannig and Mardiros, grew up speaking, reading and writing Armenian at home, Arabic at school and, from the fifth-grade on, English.         ``At that time in world affairs,'' she said, ``America was No. 1 in everything. Like many young persons, I ate, drank, breathed, dreamed America! From movies, I learned to speak in the American idiom. I was so infatuated with America, on my final exam in English, I scored 100 percent!''         In 1952, Aida was the first member of Iraq's Armenian community to win a Fulbright scholarship and the first of her family to leave home.         With the Fulbright foundation paying her transportation, the University of Washington waiving tuition, and Delta Zeta sorority providing room and board, Aida earned a degree in English literature. She later obtained a teaching certificate, and many years later, a master's in education.         In 1956, Aida married Bill Shanafelt, brother of one of her sorority sisters, by whom she had three sons: Armen, a Ph.D. in chemistry, now with a chemical research company in Palo Alto, Calif.; Brian, a minister with the Church of Christ in Issaquah, and Roger, a technical writer.         Sen. Warren Magnuson helped Aida obtain a permanent visa and stay in the U.S. until 1962, when she became a citizen. The following year she returned for a visit to Baghdad, in time to see her father before his death in 1964.         Her mother immigrated to the U.S. in 1967, and became a citizen in 1982. She died in 1985. Aida's sister, Maro Rogers of Lexington, S.C., and her brother, Seth Kouyoumjian of Bellevue, also became U.S. citizens.         A teacher since 1968, Aida in 1978 set up an English as a second language program for the sprawling Issaquah School District, where she remains the program's enthusiastic coordinator. She has taught children of immigrants from Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, China, Japan and Latin America - but not from Armenia.         ``We have an Armenian family that immigrated from Lebanon,'' she says, ``but they had good English when they arrived.''         When members of the state's Armenian community, about 300 strong, early this month learned of the earthquake in Soviet Armenia, they mobilized immediately to collect relief supplies and money, with Aida as co-chairwoman.         By now, she said, ``we've got two mini-storage units and the entire basement of the University Plaza Hotel stuffed full of warm clothing and blankets. We're still trying to get them to Yerevan, and if we can't, we'll see they're routed to needy persons elsewhere.''         Cash donations are still most welcome at the Earthquake Fund, checks payable to the Armenian Church of Seattle, P.O. Box 1266, Mercer Island, Wash. 98040. Information hot lines are 838-7300 and 236-1518.         Aida's group alone has raised more than $40,000 and is shipping prefabricated housing to the stricken area. Three units, each large enough to house 40 people or provide shelter for a small clinic, have been donated; Aida's group would like to purchase three more. They're also seeking donations of jet fuel. For a round trip between Seattle and Yerevan, a Boeing 747 uses $60,000 worth of gasoline.         ``The response has been overwhelming,'' says Aida. ``I could tell you all kinds of stories: like the lady who sent us $1 from her Social Security, wishing she could spare more! And the family who drove by our Lake Hills (Bellevue) clubhouse, where we were packing relief supplies, and stopped to find out what was going on. They wound up helping us all day and the next and writing out a check for $100.''         And now, said our Scheherazade, it's time to wrap up this story.         ``One day several years ago, I went with my mother to a senior citizens' club in Seattle, where we met a sweet lady in her 80s. When she learned Mannig had been one of the children victimized by the Ottoman Turks, she took my mother's hand and said, `When I was 13 years old, in Chicago, I collected $14.50 to send to ``The Starving Armenians.'' Now, I look at you and I know that my $14.50 went somewhere good.'         ``Now again,'' Aida said, ``Americans are helping, and many Armenians will owe their lives to American support.''         As for her own around-the-clock work on earthquake relief, Aida added: ``I owe it back. I'm finally giving back that $14.50. It's also strengthened my love for America, this overwhelming belief of the American people in helping others.         ``I honor and love the land of my birth and the race that contains my roots, and I keep these memories alive and green.         ``But I am an American, first, last and foremost.'
