SAN FRANCISCO - A series of sharp aftershocks caused more damage in Northern California today and rattled the nerves of Bay Area residents struggling to recover from Tuesday's catastrophic earthquake         Three major shocks, the strongest recorded at 5.1 on the Richter scale, struck early this morning. Authorities said the aftershocks were centered about 60 miles south of San Francisco.         Damage to buildings already weakened was reported south of the city and the aftershocks shook high-rise buildings, rattled windows and toppled the steeple of an historic church in Santa Cruz, a university town near the epicenter of the initial quake.         ``I couldn't stand it. When I felt my bed shaking I just grabbed my pants and got out of the place,'' said Stanley Cunningham, a businessman staying at a hotel near the San Francisco airport.         San Francisco authorities said the aftershocks were causing widespread fear among people already in shock. ``People feel their whole world could go down in pieces and it's hard for them to pick up their day-to-day lives,'' said police Capt. Bob Brown.         A total of 1,400 aftershocks - most of them minor - have been recorded since Tuesday's monster 6.9 earthquake that killed at least 273 people and injured more than 2,500. The strongest aftershock, 5.2 on the Richter scale, struck within 40 minutes of the initial jolt, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.         An earthquake registering 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate damage. A magnitude 5 quake can cause considerable damage.         Officials estimated 3,500 people have been left homeless and said 20 shelters had been opened to accommodate them. Some of the homeless were still camping in parks or sleeping in cars.         Yesterday, Gov. George Deukmejian demanded an investigation into the collapse of Interstate 880 in Oakland, saying it should have been built to withstand the devastating force of Tuesday's earthquake.         The collapse ``raises troubling questions for the entire state in terms of the construction of our freeways,'' Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson said.         Largely because of the collapse of I-880, known as the Nimitz Freeway, the quake was the second-deadliest in U.S. history. It killed an estimated 271    people - 250 of them in the rubble of the Nimitz - and crippled transportation, electric power and commerce in the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan area.         Today, workers dug into a mile-long slab of collapsed freeway with fading hopes that anyone might be alive.         Besides the commuters killed in the freeway collapse, at least 21 people died in San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties. State officials said 1,400 people were injured throughout the Bay Area, although hospitals said they treated 2,750 people, many for chest pains.         San Francisco officials said the quake caused $2 billion in damage in the city alone.         President Bush said today he will visit Northern California tomorrow to get a firsthand look at earthquake damage and ``to provide encouragement'' to victims.         The visit will include a helicopter survey of the affected areas. The president also will meet with local officials, said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.         At the same time, Fitzwater accused San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos of deciding ``not to cooperate'' in ensuring a full federal response to Tuesday's killer earthquake.         Firing back hard at criticism leveled one day earlier at Vice President Dan Quayle, Fitzwater alleged Agnos has refused invitations to meetings and telephone calls from the administration.         The sharp White House retort, the first hint of political recriminations over the disaster and its aftermath, came after a miffed Agnos dismissed Quayle's visit to the area yesterday as ``a publicity trip.''         Meanwhile, more relief began to flow in from places as far afield as South Carolina, Japan and Great Britain. Israel and France offered to send disaster teams experienced in finding victims trapped beneath wreckage.         Officials in Los Alamos, N.M., dispatched a device used to find survivors of last winter's earthquake in Soviet Armenia.         Hope was fading, however, that anyone would be found alive in the quake debris.         In the affluent waterside Marina District, two bodies were seen in the rubble of a four-story apartment building. They were clutching each other's hands, said Dr. Charles Saunders of the city Health Department.         ``There were no signs of life,'' he said. ``It's very unlikely anyone else will be found alive.''         Seven bodies were recovered from the Nimitz Freeway earlier in the day and police said at least 86 people were officially reported missing. The quake hit at rush hour, and state officials estimated there were 250 cars caught in the collapse.         The Nimitz death count was based on an optimistic assumption of one person per car.         A remote-control backhoe was flown in by helicopter to dig out the rubble  but couldn't begin operation until workers shored up the mile-long stretch of collapsed roadway with piles of steel and wood.         Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., got an overhead view of the crushed freeway from a helicopter and offered a horrific description: ``It looked like a snake hacked with an ax. It was in bits and pieces.''         Downtown San Francisco's high-rise buildings, which swayed sickeningly during the 15-second quake, came through it virtually unscathed. Entire residential neighborhoods pitched and swayed but emerged intact.         ``We do have specific earthquake designs for all of the buildings,'' Deukmejian said. ``And, of course, most of these buildings have not been damaged. They have withstood the severity of this quake because of their designs.''         The Bay Area's residents also earned praise. There were few reports of looting or other crimes, and many reports of calm and compassion in the face of catastrophe.         ``This is an incredible coming together; an act of the brotherly love that San Franciscans were famous for in the '60s,'' self-described ``ex-hippie'' Chuck Rosen said as he helped clear rubble from a collapsed building.         Many people appeared unruffled by the quake, and there were pictures of unexpected serenity: joggers loping through Golden Gate Park, sunbathers enjoying warm weather at the park's band shell.         But the band shell, a favorite of San Franciscans for the better part of a century, was badly damaged, and many lives were shattered as well.         Tony Thomas, 42, manager of an apartment building that had visible cracks on its facade, slept in a park across the street. He refused to sleep in a shelter.         ``I just have this phobia about being inside a building. It feels like the bed is still moving. It's done a number on me,'' said Thomas, carrying a pillow, blanket and essential goods in a milk crate. He suffered a chipped tooth, bruised arm and cut foot from a shard of glass in the quake.         ``The first words out of my mouth were, `That's it for me. I'm moving back East,' '' he said.         Even for those less scarred by the experience, life was returning to normal slowly.         Many offices remained closed. The Bay Bridge, the lifeline that links Oakland and San Francisco, was expected to be closed at least for another one or two weeks while a collapsed section is repaired.         BART, the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system, reopened and then closed again when a train operator reported a leak in the tube beneath the bay.         Airports were open, however, and ferries from Southern California were steaming north to bolster the overburdened Bay Area commuter fleet.         Pacific Gas & Electric had restored electricity to about half the residential customers in San Francisco by last night, but about 300,000 customers south of the city remained without power.         There were at least a few hopeful signs.         Economic experts said the damage to the region's economy would probably be short-lived.         ``Overall the impact will be one the state will recover from very quickly,'' said John Sullivan, undersecretary of the state Department of Business, Transportation and Housing.         ``We have a large, strong economy, and while the personal tragedy for many families is great, the overall economic picture for the Bay Area and the rest of the state is unclouded by this,'' he said.
