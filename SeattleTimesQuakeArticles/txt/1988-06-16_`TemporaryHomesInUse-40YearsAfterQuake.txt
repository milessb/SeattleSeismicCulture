MOSCOW - Forty years after an earthquake flattened the city of Ashkhabad in Soviet Central Asia, 18,000 people are living in ``temporary'' shacks, the newspaper Sovietskaya Kultura said today.         The newspaper gave one of the first Soviet accounts of the 1948 disaster. It revealed that 110,000 people, out of Ashkhabad's population of 132,000, were killed in the quake.        ``To this day, 2,700 temporary shacks remain, housing 18,000 people,'' Sovietskaya Kultura quoted an official as saying last month at a session of Turkmenia's parliament.        Contemporary reports of the earthquake, which according to Western accounts devastated the entire city, were suppressed in line with previous Soviet policy of not reporting disasters.        This policy has been reversed under the policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness, expounded by Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. Soviet accidents and natural disasters now are frequently reported within hours.        Ashkhabad, in a region notorious for seismic activity, has been rebuilt with buildings designed to resist earthquakes.        But Sovietskaya Kultura said the city still suffers from power shortages and noted that many apartments lack a gas supply, even though the area is the second-highest natural-gas-producing region in the Soviet Union.
