It's April 15. All taxpayers must have their returns postmarked by midnight tonight. Well, not exactly. This year, the traditional deadline for filing income taxes with the Internal Revenue Service falls on a Sunday. That means all taxpayers were given until the next weekday, Monday the 16th, to file. And that was equally true in Washington state until the Nisqually Earthquake hit Feb. 28. After a 20-county area was declared a disaster area, the federal government granted those living in the affected area a two-week reprieve. That means if you don't have your taxes done by now, you can still go out, enjoy the spring day, roll a few Easter eggs and pig out on Peeps without worrying about Uncle Sam. You have until April 30 to file your return or to file Form 4868 asking for a four-month extension. To take advantage of either extension, you must file your taxes the old-fashioned way--no electronic returns--and you must write in big, red letters "Washington State Earthquake" on the top of the return form. There is, however, no extension of time to make an individual-retirement-account contribution. The deadline for contributions for 2000 remains Monday. The deadline for contributions to simplified employee pensions or Keogh retirement plans is the return due date, including extensions. Confused? You may call the IRS, 800-829-1040, or visit its Web site,       www.irs.gov,       for help. Tax forms and tips are also at        www.seattletimes.com/taxtips. A number that may prove handy in the future, should you have problems, is the Taxpayer Advocate at 877-777-4778. The two-week reprieve is available to residents of these counties: Benton, Clallam, Clark, Cowlitz, Grays Harbor, Island, Jefferson, King, Kitsap, Lewis, Mason, Pacific, Pierce, Skagit, Skamania, Snohomish, Thurston, Whatcom, Wahkiakum and Yakima.
