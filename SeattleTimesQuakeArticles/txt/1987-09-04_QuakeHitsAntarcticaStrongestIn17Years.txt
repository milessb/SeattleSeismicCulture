HONOLULU _ An earthquake struck near Antarctica yesterday, and federal officials called it the strongest to hit the region in the past 17 years.        The quake, measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale, hit yesterday morning about 500 miles north of Cape Adare in Victorialand in Antarctica, a Washington-based Geological Survey spokesman said. It was the strongest earthquake in the area since a 7.2 quake hit June 11, 1970, he said.        The magnitude of Thursday's quake was not great enough to generate a Pacific-wide tsunami, or tidal wave, according to the Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu.
