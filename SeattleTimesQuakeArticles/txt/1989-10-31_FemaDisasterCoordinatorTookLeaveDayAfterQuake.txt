WASHINGTON - The Federal Emergency Management Agency's top medical disaster coordinator went on vacation, with his supervisor's permission, the day after the earthquake struck California, FEMA officials acknowledged yesterday         The departure of Lt. Col. Jerry Brown before the extent of casualties was known raises fresh questions about the agency's management. Its top eight positions are vacant or filled with temporary holdovers from the Reagan administration, and President Bush has named one official awaiting Senate confirmation.         Critics of the disaster-coordinating agency have said FEMA has been strained to the limit in coping with two natural disasters within four weeks - Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta quake in California.         Brown, medical coordinator for the Office of Mobilization Preparedness, was informed of the quake's magnitude on the evening it occurred, Oct. 17, and told his supervisor that he had scheduled vacation leave and had purchased nonrefundable airline tickets, according to FEMA spokesman Bill McAda.         ``He stayed in the office all night before leaving,'' McAda said. ``His supervisor was well aware of the situation and did not cancel the leave.''         Brown said he ``took care of everything that needed to be taken care of'' before leaving. ``My heart, soul and body are in that program,'' he said, but he declined to answer questions about why he went on vacation.         Brown, on assignment to FEMA from the Army Medical Service Corps, is the FEMA representative on the National Disaster Medical System, composed of representatives of the departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense, FEMA and the Public Health Service, a subdivision of the Department of Health and Human Services.         The system is charged with the medical response to national disasters and conventional warfare abroad, according to Calvin Freeman, head of the disaster medical-services section in California.         ``We are not the lead agency'' on the National Disaster Medical System, McAda said. He said that a full representative of the system was present at FEMA immediately after the quake.         ``The absence of Jerry did not make any impact,'' he said. ``We were totally covered without him.''         Freeman said Brown was in charge of ``a thousand and one details'' involved in planning for a joint state-federal exercise in August to prepare for handling a major emergency in California.         Examples of the kinds of details to be resolved, he said, were logistical concerns about where a disaster medical-assistance team would sleep and be fed. Preparations for the exercise also involved dealing with a military commander on whose base the exercise was held, he said.
