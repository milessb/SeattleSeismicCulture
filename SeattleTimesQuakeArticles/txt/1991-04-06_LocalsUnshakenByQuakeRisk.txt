Consider the enormous force necessary to squeeze mountain peaks closer together, which apparently is happening in the Olympic Mountains.         That stored-up energy has worried scientists for years. If the pressure were suddenly released, Western Washington would rebound like a spring. It could trigger an earthquake as big as the world has seen.         The most precise measurements so far of that squeezing pressure, announced yesterday, show that mountains 18 miles apart have indeed moved about an inch closer in eight years.         The same squeezing tilted up the coast while Puget Sound dropped like a teeter-totter.         But the report, by the U.S. Geological Survey, caused more excitement elsewhere than it did here where scientists have been saying the same thing for years. A New York Times headline said, "Geologists See Huge Quake Risk in the Northwest."      "They're late coming to the party," said Stewart Smith, professor of geophysics at the University of Washington. "Everyone else has been saying it for at least five years."         In recent years, there have been estimates that this area is vulnerable to earthquakes of 9 or greater on the Richter scale, hundreds of times stronger than any others recorded here.      The estimated magnitude of the state's biggest quake, in 1872, was 7.5. The largest recorded quakes in the Puget Sound area have been 7.1 in 1949 and 6.5 in 1965.         The squeezing detected by the USGS study results from an undersea collision. About 60 miles off the Washington-Oregon-British Columbia coast, a section of ocean bottom pushes against the continent. As the bottom segment, known as the Juan de Fuca Plate, encounters the continental shelf, it dives or subducts beneath the lighter rock of the continent.         The subducting Juan de Fuca Plate moves steadily, at a rate of almost 2 inches a year. But scientists believe the upper edge of the diving plate is stuck against overlying rock. As the rest of the plate moves, pressure builds up on the stuck edge. The resulting compression tilts up the outer coast and squeezes the ground surface.         James Savage and Michael Lisowski of the USGS office in Menlo Park, Calif., installed eight surveying stations above timberline in the Olympic Mountains and began measuring distances between the peaks with a laser device in 1982. The squeezing they detected "will eventually rupture in a great thrust earthquake," they predicted.         Tom Heaton of the USGS office in Pasadena, Calif., has long said geological conditions in the Pacific Northwest are similar to those in Chile and Alaska, scenes of some of the world's greatest quakes.         "The largest fault in the United States is off the Pacific Northwest Coast," Heaton said. "It's certainly bigger than the San Andreas Fault here in California."        There are three worries about big faults. When a big one breaks loose, the resulting shaking is more intense, the shaking continues longer and there is more likelihood the quake will trigger a damaging tsunami.         The Loma Prieta quake in California's Bay Area in 1989 caused 15 seconds of shaking. Heaton said a great quake in the Pacific Northwest could shake for three minutes or longer.         "The shaking was as long as five minutes in the Alaska earthquake in 1964," he said.         Buildings that can withstand 15 seconds of shaking could well fail after several minutes of stress.      The Olympic Mountains study succeeds Savage's work beginning in 1972 when he began measuring distances across Puget Sound, from Gold Mountain behind Bremerton to Tiger Mountain near Issaquah.
