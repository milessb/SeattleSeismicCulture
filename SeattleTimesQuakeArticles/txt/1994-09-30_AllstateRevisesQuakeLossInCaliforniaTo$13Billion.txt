NORTHBROOK, Ill. - Insurance company Allstate Corp. said yesterday it raised its loss estimate from the January earthquake in southern California to $1.3 billion from $950 million.     Based on this estimate, Allstate, parent of Allstate Insurance Co., the nation's largest publicly held property and casualty insurance firm, said its earnings will be cut by about $845 million after taxes for all of 1994.     Allstate said the revised losses will cut its third-quarter earnings by about $228 million.     The increased estimate reflects extensive additional damage discovered as rebuilding efforts progress.     Rising costs associated with construction and new claims also contributed to the increased estimate. Total Allstate claims are now estimated at about 45,000.
