Taxpayers who suffered a financial loss in Wednesday's earthquake won't have to wait a year to claim their losses on their federal tax return. When President Bush declared the state a federal disaster area Thursday, he cleared the way for taxpayers in designated counties to claim the loss when they file their tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service this year. Judy Monahan, an IRS spokeswoman in Seattle, said business owners and individuals in counties the Federal Emergency Management Agency has listed can take the loss either this year or on their 2001 return, depending on which year is more financially advantageous. "You'd want to find out how much your insurance is or is not going to cover, or if you have coverage at all," said Monahan. "Then you'd want to estimate next year and check to see which year would benefit you the most." In Western Washington, King, Pierce, Kitsap, Thurston, Lewis and Mason counties are on FEMA's list. So far, Snohomish County isn't, though that could change. The filing deadline for individual returns is midnight, April 16.       Robert T. Nelson's telephone message number is 206-464-2996. His e-mail address is rnelson@seattletimes.com.
