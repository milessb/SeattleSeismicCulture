EVERETT Three representatives from the Snohomish County Red Cross flew to Northern California yesterday to help with earthquake disaster-relief efforts.     Disaster Director Dottie Stewart and disaster volunteers Don Mell and Geri Moore will help at Red Cross shelters, which so far have served 5,000 people.     Shelters provide hot meals, sleeping accommodations, disaster-assistance information and nurses for minor first aid.     Saturday's 6.9 earthquake and its aftershocks destroyed 108 residences and caused major damage to 139 others.     Affected communities include Ferndale, Hydesville, Petrolia, Rio Dell, Scotia and Stafford, all about 200 miles north of San Francisco.     For disaster questions, call 1-800-547-0541 between 8:30 a.m. and 7 p.m.     Donations may be sent to the National Disaster Relief Fund, American Red Cross, P.O. Box 5672, Everett 98206.
