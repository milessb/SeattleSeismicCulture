MOSCOW - Nearly 8,000 people were evacuated from cities and towns shattered by Armenia's earthquake as authorities began trying to clear the area of all but workers involved in the cleanup effort, Pravda reported today        An additional 4,500 mothers and children were expected to leave today for Anapa, a Soviet children's resort in the Crimea, the official Communist Party newspaper said. Within two to three days, only men involved in the reconstruction should remain, it said.        The Tass news agency said the Soviet Union reached agreement with American Telephone & Telegraph Co. to allow Armenians to call collect to the United States, where many have friends and relatives. Soviet citizens usually cannot place collect calls.        The official news agency said that since the quake, telephone traffic between Armenia and the United States has increased eight-fold.        Armenians ``whose senses have been dulled by grief'' still hope to find survivors under collapsed homes and apartment buildings, state-run Radio Moscow said yesterday, 11 days after the earthquake that killed an estimated 55,000 people.        Pravda said 15,252 people were dug out alive from the rubble in the first 10 days after the quake.        More than 23,000 bodies have been recovered, but that is less than half the total believed buried in piles of stone and concrete dust in the cities of Spitak, Leninakan, Kirovakan and up to 100 villages.        ``The smell is becoming more and more pronounced every day'' in Spitak, said Boris Yurchenko, an Associated Press photographer.  The city was nearly deserted, with a few people searching for relatives remaining behind and taking shelter in garages, he said.        Fifteen thousand of Spitak's 30,000 people are believed dead.         Snow and freezing temperatures hampered relief efforts and posed additional hardships for thousands of people left homeless.        ``The first, most acute phase of the rescue effort is coming to an end,'' Radio Moscow said. ``Preparations have started for restoring the industries and housing.''        There has been no official announcement of an end to the search for survivors, a potentially explosive issue in Armenia, where some people have sat in front of bulldozers to prohibit clearing of rubble until it can be searched for victims.        ``Hopes for saving them are slim,'' a commission of the ruling Communist Party Politburo concluded yesterday. ``But no matter how hard it is, no one has the right to start fully clearing the grounds of factories and plants until that operation is complete.''        Armenian activists, embittered by Moscow's refusal to grant their demands in a territorial dispute with neighboring Azerbaijan, have accused the central government of not doing enough to warn Armenians of the danger of an impending earthquake and of bungling relief efforts.        Soviet media continued to report on an official crackdown against Armenian militants, six of whose leaders have been arrested.        The committee has spearheaded the 11-month-old campaign for annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan.Caption:  PHOTOAP / TASS: A WOMAN AND HER CHILD BUNDLE UP AGAINST THE COLD IN MAKESHIFT QUARTERS IN THE RUBBLE OF THEIR HOME IN SPITAK, ARMENIA.
