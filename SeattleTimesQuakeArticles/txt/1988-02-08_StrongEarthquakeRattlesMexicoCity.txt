A strong earthquake shook Mexico City today, causing downtown buildings to sway and creak. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.        The temblor, at 7:51 Mexico City time (5:51 PST), lasted for at least 30 seconds, with an intensity of 6.0 on the Richter scale, the National University of Mexico's seismological institute reported.        The institute said the quake's epicenter was about 100 miles off the coast of Guerrero state, in the Pacific Ocean. Acapulco is at the approximate center of the Guerrero coast.        Red Cross and police said they had no immediate reports of casualties or property damage.        Many of those Mexico City residents who were riding buses or the subway, or driving to work in the morning rush hour said they did not feel the quake.        Laborers repairing a building damaged in the Sept. 19, 1985, earthquake stopped work briefly because of the quake, then resumed their tasks.        At least 9,500 people were killed in the 1985 earthquake disaster that devastated large sections of the capital. A ``great quake'' measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale on Sept. 19 was followed by a second quake measuring 7.6 on the scale, the next day.        Eighteen minutes after today's Mexico City quake, at 6:09 a.m. PST, a 3.6 magnitude quake occurred about 10 miles southeast of San Jose, Calif., and was felt in San Jose, the U.S. Geological Survey reported in Washington. No damage was reported, and Geological Survey scientists said the quakes did not appear to be related.        The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase in one number means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage.        An earthquake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A magnitude 7 quake is a major earthquake.
