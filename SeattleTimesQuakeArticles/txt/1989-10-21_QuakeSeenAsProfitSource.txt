NEW YORK - Call it opportunity or ghoulish economics, but the earthquake that devastated the San Francisco Bay area this week has aroused enthusiasm among investors and speculators as a new source of multibillion-dollar profits         Almost immediately after the quake collapsed buildings and entombed motorists in crushed cars under a toppled freeway, market strategists were busy reckoning which companies would benefit from demand for reconstruction and federal aid.         Shares of homebuilders, cement makers and lumber companies got a big boost from the quake. Some large insurance companies also benefited on the hunch that they would be able to use the opportunity to raise rates.         A few leading Wall Street brokerages were touting Georgia-Pacific and Willamette Industries Inc., for example, as opportunities in what The Wall Street Journal described as ``the best post-quake plywood plays.''         Many economists say the quick response by investors is part of the efficiency that makes the American economy function smoothly.         Some even say that profound calamities such as earthquakes and hurricanes actually boost overall economic growth over a long period of time by creating an enormous demand for goods and services in afflicted areas. A few suggested the earthquake helped stabilize the wobbly U.S. stock market.         ``The initial impact is a drain on the growth rate of the economy,'' said Thomas  Carpenter, director of economics for ASB Capital Management, a Washington investment concern. But later, he said, ``what is torn down gets rebuilt. And that rebuilding activity is obviously a generator of income and employment and acts as a positive factor, a positive thrust.''         Other economists disagree. They say disasters are bad, period.         ``I guess I don't have a lot of sympathy with the argument that if you want to have a robust economy, you ought to have a war,'' said Gail Fosler, chief economist of the Conference Board, a New York-based business research group.         Deborah Allen, president of the Claremont Economics Institute, a consulting firm in Claremont, Calif., said the argument that disasters create economic growth is flawed because wealth must be destroyed first.         ``You have a tremendous growth spurt, but it's from a lower base,'' she said. ``A few years later . . . you're worse off. You haven't produced something new that you didn't have yesterday.''         Guy Henshaw, president of Civicbankcorp in Oakland, Calif., said there probably was some truth to the idea that the infrastructure damage to the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan area would generate much more economic activity. He said rumors were circulating that vast areas of downtown office space in Oakland were condemned because of damage.         ``That means some of the overcapacity has gone away. That will help,'' he said. ``It's somewhat black humor, but at least we've got the capacity to rebuild.'
