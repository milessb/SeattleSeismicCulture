PALMER, Alaska     A strong but deep earthquake yesterday jolted residents of Amchitka Island in the Aleutians, but no damage was reported, according to the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center.    Guy Urban of the observatory said a preliminary reading of 6.1 was recorded for the temblor at 7:52 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.    The tremor was centered in an active earthquake zone about 40 miles northwest of the island and about 80 miles beneath the surface, deep enough to avoid damage to people or property, he said.
