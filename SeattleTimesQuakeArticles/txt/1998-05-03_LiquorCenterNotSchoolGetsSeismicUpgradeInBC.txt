VANCOUVER, B.C. - British Columbia's biggest stash of liquor is safe from an earthquake.    But the provincial government says it doesn't have the money to reinforce a school just down the street, attended by 2,000 children.    The liquor distribution center on Vancouver's East Broadway Avenue was seismically upgraded shortly after a $2 million plan to upgrade Vancouver Technical School was canceled.    "I'd love to see the risk analysis they based that decision on," said Tony Angel, a former Vancouver school board official.    The liquor branch, like other crown corporations, has the money and authority to act on its own, government spokesman Peter Cech said.    Since 1993, when the provincial government put a hold on all stand-alone seismic upgrades of British Columbia schools, the Employment and Investment Ministry has been working on a priority list of government-owned buildings that need upgrades. These include schools, hospitals and prisons.
