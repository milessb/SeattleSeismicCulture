BELLEVUE      In an effort to ensure bridges and overpasses don't fall during an earthquake, the state Department of Transportation will close the westbound exit of Interstate 90 to Bellevue Way Southeast for the next three nights for earthquake-proofing work     The closures will start at 10 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and reopen again at 5 a.m. the following day. Motorists who want to take the westbound exit to Bellevue Way Southeast will have to drive to  Mercer Island on I-90, take the East Mercer exit and go back to Bellevue Way's eastbound exit.     While the closures are to start tonight,  installing the supports depends on the weather. If it rains or snows, the work will be delayed.
