KALAMATA, Greece _ A powerful earthquake toppled buildings and damaged scores of homes yesterday in the southern port city of Kalamata, killing at least 10 people, injuring 300 and sending panicked families fleeing into the streets     The government declared a state of emergency and began airlifting medical supplies and tents to the city of about 80,000 in the Peloponnesus region 110 miles southwest of Athens.     The earthquake, measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale, struck at 10:27 p.m. and was followed about three hours later by a temblor with a 5.4 magnitude, the Athens Seismological Institute said. Both earthquakes were centered in the Ionian Sea. Aftershocks shook the city through the night.     ``There is confusion and panic in the streets,'' a police spokesman said. ``The city parks are full of crowds of men, women and children afraid to stay near buildings in case of another earthquake. No one is indoors. The whole city is outside.''     The first temblor collapsed many older homes and a five-story apartment building.     At least 10 people were found dead in the debris of the apartment building, the state-run Athens radio said. Seventy of the injured were reportedly seriously hurt.     The earthquake damaged hundreds of buildings, including the city hall and police headquarters.     Athens radio said the injured were being ferried back to Athens for treatment because Kalamata's only hospital suffered serious structural damage.
