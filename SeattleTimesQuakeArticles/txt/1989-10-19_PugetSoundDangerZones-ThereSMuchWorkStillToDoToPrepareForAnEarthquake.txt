Scientists and engineers in Seattle yesterday portrayed the San Francisco earthquake as a warning signal for the Northwest to better prepare itself.         We've come a long way in getting ready for a big quake, they say. But there's still a lot left to do - and a lot to learn.         Among the danger zones in the Puget Sound region? Older bridges and the freeway approaches to the West Seattle Bridge, hundreds of aging brick and stone buildings in King and Pierce counties, Harbor Island, the filled-in areas of the Kent and Duwamish valleys.         The seismic rule of thumb is that older bridges and buildings - especially pre-1975 - might be more likely to topple.         ``I think it is likely to be a problem with many of the bridges around here,'' concluded  Neil Hawkins, an associate dean and professor of civil engineering at the University of Washington. ``It all would depend on the severity of the earthquake.''         Skyscrapers aren't a big worry. ``They sway around like bamboo fishing poles,'' explained Neil Twelker, a geotechnical consultant. ``The structures that are likely to get hurt the most in an earthquake are the real stiff, blocky old buildings that have no flexibility.''         The likelihood of a major quake remains subject to some debate.         State building codes are based on a seismic level one below the preparedness that is required in parts of California and Alaska, in part because a catastrophic quake has not been recorded here.         Those codes affect how things are built, from a kitchen remodeling to the new Interstate 90 tunnel.         ``There were major changes in our codes and way of thinking after the 1971 quake in Los Angeles,'' said John Clark, chief bridges engineer with Andersen Bjornstad Kane Jacobs Inc., a Seattle engineering firm.         ``Anything designed in the last 15 years is probably designed as good as we know how to do.''         The codes require new buildings to suffer no more than minor, nonstructural damage in a moderate earthquake, and to remain standing in a major earthquake, according to Tom Kinsman, supervising senior engineer for the Seattle Department of Construction and Land Use.         But some scientists say there is a false sense of security.         A U.S. Geological Survey scientist working at the UW insisted the Puget Sound area might be due for a quake the likes of which it hasn't seen in 300 years - nothing like the shakers of '49 and '65 which local structures survived.         ``At a minimum, what happened 300 years ago was at least a 100-kilometer-long stretch of southern Washington dropped down from two to 10 feet,'' Brian Atwater of the USGS said yesterday.         Some officials predicted the San Francisco disaster might shake a money tree for preparedness in the Northwest. City and state studies of bridge and building safety are pending. Local scientists want more earthquake sensors.         ``It's very difficult to persuade people that a small investment now can save a lot of money in the future until they see something like the San Francisco earthquake,'' Hawkins said.         Just how safe are the region's bridges, roads and buildings?         It'll take a big quake in just the right place to tell us for sure.         But the state's more than 3,000 bridges are designed to remain serviceable during a ``medium'' earthquake and to not collapse during a major earthquake.  Bridges are inspected about every two years.         An earthquake of magnitude 4 on the Richter scale is considered moderate; a magnitude 7 quake is a major earthquake, capable of widespread damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake capable of tremendous damage.         ``We expect with severe quakes there will be some damage,'' says Al Walley, bridge and structures engineer for the state Department of Transportation. ``To tell you all of our structures will withstand any earthquake - that's not correct.'' Old bridges which have undergone substantial modification also have been seismically upgraded. But others have not.         The Department of Transportation has identified 100 or so bridges that seem to be potentially earthquake vulnerable and will study them. But no program specifically for seismic retrofitting of bridges is in place.         ``I think we need to look at that. Over the years . . .  what we know about seismic activity has increased greatly,'' said Walley.         One local question remains unanswered: How similar is the busy Alaskan Way Viaduct on Seattle's waterfront to the Interstate 880 freeway in Oakland that killed more than 250 people in its Tuesday collapse?         The viaduct is not on the state's list of bridges with details that could be potentially vulnerable to earthquakes, said Walley.         ``While we would certainly expect it to move during an earthquake, we think it has sufficient support to handle some of these greater motions,'' he said. ``Some of our confidence there comes from the fact that it has endured at least one (in 1965).''         The beams of the viaduct are cast into the columns, whereas in Oakland the deck beams rest atop the columns. If they weren't so tied together on the viaduct, one structural component could move irrespective of another, as appears to have happened on Oakland.          Gerry Smith, the state Department of Transportation's district operations engineer, said his first thought after seeing the Oakland disaster was how much that two-tier concrete bridge looked like Seattle's viaduct.         UW engineering professors also noticed the surface similarities between the older, concrete structures.         But the state's bridge management engineer, Bob George, said no similarities were known other than appearance.         ``Without having more information on the other structure, I wouldn't know more similarities,'' George said.         He said the investigation in Oakland will be closely watched from Olympia, and its lessons may be applied to the viaduct or any other structures believed to be at risk.         George said the viaduct is fully inspected every two years.         Among city-owned transportation facilities, the new West Seattle bridges are universally regarded as earthquake-resistant. But the approaches to the high-level bridge (the Spokane Street Viaduct on the east, the Fauntleroy Expressway on the west) and a little-used bridge structure over Harbor Avenue are viewed as high priorities to inspect for earthquake dangers. They were identified yesterday by Bruce Wasell, principal assistant director of engineering services for the Seattle Engineering Department.         At the same time, Wasell also provided a list of older bridges owned by the city that have been rehabilitated or replaced since the mid-'70s.         Wasell said he and other city officials will develop a priority list of bridges that need inspection and possible strengthening. The list will be done early next week. The City Council may be asked to add $100,000 to $200,000 to the mayor's proposed budget to conduct the study.         Hawkins said the state Department of Transportation is also proposing a study of earthquake readiness of major thoroughfares, known as ``lifelines.''         ``They're very aware of the fact they should be retrofitting some of their bridges, and I think this will move that forward,'' Hawkins said.         The upland areas in Seattle are generally very firm soils - ``They will simply shake hard and fast,'' Twelker said. ``If you're around the edge of where the slopes are steep they could shake hard and fast and something could fall off. . . . But if you're in the middle of Queen Anne Hill and your building is well put together, nothing much would happen.''         Older buildings in Seattle need to be seismically upgraded only when the owner wants to substantially rehabilitate a structure. In Los Angeles,such retrofitting of certain masonry buildings is required, whether or not a general fix-up is planned.         The state of California is requiring each municipality to identify its potentially hazardous buildings by January of next year. From there, the cities can do as little as informing owners they have potentially hazardous buildings or as much as Los Angeles, requiring the buildings be retrofitted.         It's only a matter of time - or a disaster on the scale of San Francisco's - before Seattle requires retrofitting of all old buildings, says Kinsman.         It's only a matter of time - or a disaster on the scale of San Francisco's - before Seattle requires retrofitting of all old buildings, says Kinsman.         ``I think it's too bad that it will possibly take an earthquake to have that discussed,'' he said.         People who live or work in older masonry buildings might not be in as much risk as they think. A 1975 Geological Survey study found 467 structures in all parts of Seattle and 166 in Tacoma that were the most likely candidates for falling down in an earthquake.         But more than 100 of those buildings in Seattle have been reinforced over the past 10 years, according to a rough estimate by Kinsman. To tell if a masonry building has been shored up, look for bolts anchoring the wall to the floor, he said. They can be seen from the exterior in the form of button-like fixtures along floor levels.         While the brick buildings of Pioneer Square remain on the suspect list, many of downtown Seattle's landmarks were said yesterday to be relatively safe in an earthquake.         ``Smith Tower has a steel frame in it, and I don't suppose there's reason to believe it would be particularly sensitive,'' said John Stanton, a civil engineering professor at the University of Washington.         ``The area I would choose not to be if there were an earthquake would be some of the older buildings around Pioneer Square. Now, most of those have been upgraded and strengthened, but there's only so much you can do to boost that support.''         ``The newer buildings, designed by the more current codes, are going to be the safest buildings - assuming they meet those codes,'' says Art Barkshire, principal with Skilling, Ward, Magnusson, Barkshire, Inc. The company was structural engineer on the Convention Center and many of the newest skyscrapers downtown, including Two Union Square, AT&T Gateway Tower and Pacific First Centre.         In Barkshire's opinion, Seattle's building review and inspection process ``gives reasonable assurance'' those codes are being met.         Jack Christiansen, structural engineer who designed the Kingdome, said the Dome might crack in a major earthquake but it is not likely the roof would collapse.         ``In a major earthquake there will be damage, cracks, broken glass,'' he said. ``To design it otherwise, the cost would be so high it would have a serious economic impact on the area.''         Buildings most at risk would be four-to seven-stories on poor soil, Hawkins said. The soil problems are present in some of the industrial areas of South Seattle and near Kent.         Harbor Island is considered vulnerable because its soil is loose and granular, said Twelker, the geotechnical consultant. ``When you shake that real hard it will liquefy,'' he said.         The Seattle School District has studied the earthquake vulnerability of its 100 or so buildings, most of which were constructed before 1950.         ``We determined there were some that needed some seismic improvement,'' said John Jacobsen, manager of the district's capital improvement program.         During the last five years, the district has upgraded about 30 of its old unreinforced masonry type schools and is now replacing 16 schools. About 40 to 50 buildings still need seismic updating.         Connections are improved between floors and walls and the roof and walls. Brick exterior which could fall off is tied back. Chimneys are shortened. The height of parapets is reduced.         But in the earthquake business nothing is a certainty.         As engineer Barkshire puts it: ``You realize we're dealing with earthquakes. Nobody knows for sure what those forces are. There are still lots of unknowns.''         That's why engineers are ``crawling all over San Francisco and Oakland'' to find out what went right and wrong, he said.

The list was compiled by the Seattle Engineering Department.    - Airport Way South over Argo Railyard.    - First Avenue South over Argo Railyard.    - Fourth Avenue South over Argo Railyard.    - Airport Way South from Fourth Avenue South to Fifth Avenue South.    - South Jackson Street from Fourth Avenue South to Fifth Avenue South.    - South Lucille Street at Airport Way South    - Southwest Nevada Street at 28th Avenue Southwest.    - Southwest Spokane Street (low level) at East Waterway.    - West Seattle High-Level Bridge,    - Yesler Way over Fourth Avenue.    - Yesler Way over Fifth Avenue.    - Fourth Avenue South, South Jackson Street to Airport Way South.    - Second Avenue South extension at South Jackson Street.    - Northwest  57th Street at 37th Place Northwest.    - West Fort Street at Government Way.    - 23rd Avenue West at Government Way.    --------------------------------------------------    HOW SEATTLE STRUCTURES WOULD FARE IN AN EARTHQUAKE    --------------------------------------------------    Here are brief descriptions of how several Seattle structures would fare in an earthquake, according to architects, designers, engineers and government officials.    1. THE ALASKAN WAY VIADUCT    The viaduct survived the '65 quake and state officials believe it has enough support to handle some great motions. Although the Oakland freeway that collapsed looks like the viaduct, the beams of the viaduct are cast into columns; in Oakland, the deck beams rest atop the columns. While the structural components are tied together on the viaduct, it appears one structural component could move irrespective of another in Oakland. State officials inspect the viaduct every two years.    2. BRIDGES    The state's more than 3,000 bridges are designed to remain serviceable during a ``medium'' earthquake and to not collapse during a major earthquake. State officials have identified about 100 bridges with aspects that seem to be potentially earthquake vulnerable. In Seattle, the I-5 Ship Canal Bridge, the two-tier freeway structure, is made of steel and thus less brittle and breakable than concrete structures. The new West Seattle bridges are regarded as warathquake-resistant, but the appro aches at both ends of the high-level bridge are not.    3. WASHINGTON STATE CONVENTION AND TRADE CENTER    The convention center, which straddles I-5, was designed to withstand an earthquake which measures more than 8 on the Richter Scale, a ``great'' quake capable of tremendous damage.    4. THE KINGDOME    The Kingdome designer says the Dome might crack in a major earthquake, but it is not likely the roof would collapse. The Dome gets its strength from more than 40 ribs, the compression ring at the top of the dome and the compression at the bottom.    5. PIONEER SQUARE    Home of many classic earthquake targets - older masonry buildings. Although many of the buildings have been reinforced, engineers caution there's only so much that can be done to boost that support.    6. THE SPACE NEEDLE    The 608-foot, all-steel structure survived the '65 quake with only slight motion and no structural damage. The steel-and-concrete foundation begins 30 feet underground, and three pairs of steel legs support the slender tower.    7. HIGHRISES    Most of the city's skyscrapers have been built with the potential for earthquakes in mind. Tumbling glass if more likely than tumbling buildings.
