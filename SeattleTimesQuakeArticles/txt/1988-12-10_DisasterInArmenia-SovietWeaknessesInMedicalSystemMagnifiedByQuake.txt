WASHINGTON - Antiquated hospitals, chronic shortages of medications and a host of other grave weaknesses in the Soviet Union's undernourished system of medical care will probably add to the already enormous loss of life from the Armenian earthquake, analysts familiar with Soviet medicine fear        Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was expected to fly to Armenia to take personal command of a military relief effort, bringing tons of medical supplies, food, tents and blankets to the Caucasus mountain region where estimates of the death toll are approaching 100,000.        Western experts noted that the country's highly centralized government and economy lends itself to marshaling of nationwide resources in major disasters. But they said a backward system of public health care, deprived for decades of adequate funding, is likely to handicap the Armenian relief effort.        ``It's not a very hopeful situation - they lack so much,'' said Dr. Mark Field, an authority on Soviet health care at Harvard's School of Public Health and the Russian Research Center.        Until recently, Soviet officials routinely boasted of a superior health care system equipped with more hospital beds than any other nation and 1 million doctors serving a nation of 280 million people free of charge. But the advent of greater openness in the Soviet press over the last two years has revealed a far bleaker picture of a creaking and neglected system of socialized medicine as poorly equipped and ill trained as many in the Third World.        After years of suppressing health statistics as state secrets, Soviet officials now acknowledge that the quality of medical care has deteriorated since the 1960s, male life expectancy has fallen and infant mortality has soared, dropping the Soviet Union to 51st place in world rankings.        While the Soviet Union may have more hospital beds than any other nation, ``there is very little in Soviet hospitals besides beds,'' Field notes. ``Medical equipment is scarce and often of the 1940s or '50s vintage.''        Soviet newspapers now write critically of dilapidated hospitals, corrupt and underpaid doctors who earn less than the average blue-collar worker, and nationwide shortages of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals that are often more readily found in a thriving medical black market than in hospitals or drugstores.        These shortages are reflected in the government's appeal to the International Red Cross in Geneva for blood-transfusion kits and other sterile equipment. The Soviet Red Cross said yesterday that its most pressing needs are antibiotics, syringes and needles, blood collection containers, blood substitutes, surgical thread and food concentrates.        Even in Moscow's better-equipped general hospitals, nurses report sometimes being called upon to buy bandage material at neighborhood pharmacies when hospital supplies run out.        Disposable hypodermic syringes and a multitude of other sterile, throwaway equipment that Western doctors take for granted are virtually nonexistent in the Soviet Union, where hospitals are accustomed to sharpening and resharpening needles until they break or wear out. Surgical sutures are occasionally recovered from healing patients and used in another operation after modest sterilization. One effect of this recycling is a high level of hepatitis and other infections in Soviet hospitals.        ``Quite a few complications, difficulties and negative trends have been piling up in the development of health care,'' Soviet health minister Yevgeny Chazov acknowledged in a television interview in June 1987. ``We need to create the health-care service afresh.''        In rural areas like the devastated mountain region of Armenia, local hospitals and clinics not only lack modern diagnostic and surgical equipment, but half the hospitals are not equipped with hot running water or sewage systems, according to recent Soviet press reports. Some rural clinics lack telephones.        Some analysts note that the prevailing problems of public sanitation are likely to have been compounded in Armenia in the weeks preceding Wednesday's earthquake by the influx of an estimated 180,000 refugees fleeing ethnic violence in the neighboring Muslim republic of Azerbaijan.        All of the myriad problems plaguing Soviet health care - the shortages, ill-equipped hospitals, substandard training and pay of doctors and nurses - reflects what Soviet authorities now acknowledge to have been a failure by the Brezhnev leadership during the 1960s and '70s to invest in a modern system of public health.Caption:  PHOTOUPI / TASS: AN EARTHQUAKE SURVIVOR IS EVACUATED BY HELICOPTER FROM LENINAKAN, ARMENIA.
