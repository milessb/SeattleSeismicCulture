When viewers looked for news of the California earthquake Tuesday, they most often looked to ABC. Both KOMO-TV in Seattle and its national network dominated the Nielsen ratings Tuesday evening.         In the 19-city Nielsen overnight markets - San Francisco, understandably, did not check in - ABC and Ted Koppel averaged a 25.3 rating and 37 percent audience share between 9:30 and 11 p.m. EST, when all three networks went head to head. Rating points indicate the percentage of all households tuned to a network; share indicates the percentage of homes tuned in only those homes that are watching television.         NBC coverage, anchored by Tom Brokaw, had a 13.3/19; CBS's Dan Rather a 12.2/17.         Locally, KOMO also led its two network affiliate competitors in viewership for almost the entire 6 1/2 hours of live coverage. At 6 p.m. Tuesday, for example, KOMO garnered a 31.4 rating with a 51 share. KIRO followed, with a 9.6/16; KING trailed with a 9.3/15.         For much of the evening, the measure of households using television (HUT) in the Seattle area also soared almost 10 percentage points higher than the same times last week.
