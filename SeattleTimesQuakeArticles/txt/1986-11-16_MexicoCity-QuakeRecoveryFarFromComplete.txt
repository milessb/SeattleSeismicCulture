The newest stop on a tour of Mexico City is the Parque de la Solidaridad, ``Solidarity Park,'' in the heart of the Mexican capital's historically rich downtown center.         It's an attractive park, a small oasis of open space among tightly packed office high-rises. You might take it for a town square from the days of the Spanish conquistadors _ that is, until a guide tells you the park occupies the site of a hotel that collapsed in last year's earthquake.         Dedicated Sept. 19, the first anniversary of the quake, the park honors the people of Mexico City who, in a show of solidarity that crossed social and economic lines, pitched in to help care for the injured and suddenly homeless.         From a tourist's vantage, however, the city is again fully functioning. The streets are free of rubble, and traffic flows about as well as can be expected in any big, overcrowded city. The fountains, or at least most of them, splash as they were intended.         The earthquake spared most of the city's hotels and its main historic attractions _ the Metropolitan Cathedral, Spanish-colonial palaces, the Aztec Templo Mayor, the National Museum of Anthropology, among them _ and they are all open.         Yet, thousands of city residents are still without permanent housing, though much building is under way. Scattered downtown buildings _ a few hotels among them _ stand vacant and boarded, too damaged to be occupied. Some may be restored, others replaced. Those prone to earthquake damage may be torn down and the land converted to parks.         But unless visitors look for evidence of the earthquake, they might miss it. Most downtown blocks, where tourists are more apt to be, suffered no more than one or two damaged buildings. To a hurried eye, passing by in a taxi, the empty structures look no more obvious than a typical city construction site.         Only at the Plaza of Three Cultures, where a cluster of high-rise apartment buildings rises vacant over Aztec ruins and a colonial church, is the destructive power of the earthquake still readily apparent. The plaza is about a mile north of the city's principal square, the Zocalo.         ``The earthquake is behind us,'' says Antonio Enriquez Savignac, Mexico's secretary of tourism. Savignac says the principal damage was limited to an area about the size of New York's Central Park. With the exception of slight damage at the beach resort of Ixtapa southwest of Mexico City, the rest of Mexico was unaffected.         As might be expected, trip cancellations from abroad poured in following the earthquake, and the country's hotels and other tourist facilities suffered financially. But by April, the country was beginning to show what Savignac calls ``a solid increase'' in tourist activity _ prompted in part by American travelers who recognize a good bargain.         Last year, Mexico drew about 4.2 million tourists. This year it expects about 4.7 million, about 85 percent from the U.S.  Tourism is the country's second most important source of dollars following its oil exports.         In recent months, the Mexican peso has been weakening against the U.S. dollar, which is a strong stimulus for traffic south of the border.         The favorable exchange rate stems from the decline in Mexico's oil-import income since the drop in the worldwide price of oil. When the price of oil was high, it brought in $14 billion a year, says Savignac, and Mexico's economy boomed. An ``overvalued peso,'' as he puts it, made Mexico less of a tourist bargain. Mexico's oil revenues are now running about $8 billion a year. Its income from tourism is about $2 billion annually.         To offset some of the decline in its oil income, Mexico this year adopted an Immediate Action Program for the Development of Tourism to attract more tourists. One of the steps was to open the way for competitive air fares between Europe and Mexico. While this has no immediate effect on air fares from the United States, it raises the possibility that U.S.-Mexico fares similarly will be deregulated in the near future.         Other measures included an increase in the number of ``Green Angels'' patrolling the highways most heavily traveled by tourists. The Green Angels are green repair trucks that provide free road service to tourists during daylight hours. Mexico is still very sensitive to a brief flurry of reports two years ago that American tourists were being waylaid on some roads.         Among other steps to attract tourists is an increase in the number of service stations selling unleaded gasoline and providing cleaner restrooms, measures important for Americans driving their own cars into the country. Mexico's service stations, called Pemex, are government operated.         The country also has opened a ``hot line'' to Mexico City, where English-speaking operators are available 24 hours a day to answer tourist questions.  The number, (905) 250-0123, is a long-distance call from the United States. But you can call collect within Mexico.         Meanwhile, Mexico is continuing to open new beach resorts. ``Our pet baby,'' says Savignac, is Bahias de Huatulco on the Pacific Coast 125 miles south of Oaxaca. Unlike Mexico's other beach resorts with large stretches of sand, Bahias de Huatulco has a 20-mile coastline that is divided into many small coves. Among the resorts going up there is a 500-room Club Med hotel, the chain's largest in Mexico. Like Bahias de Huatulco's other new hotels, it is expected to be open for the winter of 1987.
