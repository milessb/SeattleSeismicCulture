BEIJING -- A powerful earthquake struck China's remote western region of Xinjiang this morning, killing at least 158 people and collapsing more than 1,000 houses and school buildings, a disaster official and state media said. The quake struck Bachu County on the western edge of Xinjiang, near China's mountainous border with Kyrgyzstan, at 10:03 a.m., the government said. The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., reported the quake's magnitude as 6.3, but Chinese officials said it was 6.8. Most of the dead in Bachu were in collapsed houses where the quake caught them eating breakfast, said an officer at the Bachu police station. "The death toll might increase," said Zhang Yong, director of disaster prevention for the Xinjiang Seismology Bureau. He spoke by telephone from the region's capital, Urumqi, about 1,750 miles west of Beijing. More than 1,000 houses and school buildings collapsed in one village, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. The quake also shook neighboring Jiashi County, but no deaths were reported there, Zhang said. He said buildings in Bachu were older and flimsier, while Jiashi suffered a series of severe quakes in the late 1990s and damaged houses and shops had been rebuilt using more-solid construction. Earthquakes are common in Xinjiang, especially in its west, which covers the eastern foothills of the soaring Pamir and Tianshan mountains. But they usually cause few injuries and little property damage because the area  is so sparsely populated. China's most devastating earthquake in recorded history hit northern Shaanxi province in 1556, killing an estimated 830,000 people. In 1995 China put into force a law to improve emergency response to earthquakes. State media reported at the time that more than 610,000 Chinese had been killed by earthquakes since 1900. The following is a chronology of some of the biggest Chinese earthquakes in recent decades: • January 1998 -- At least 47 people are killed and more than 2,000 injured when an earthquake measuring 6.2 rocks Hebei, devastating mud and brick homes in two rural counties. • February 1996 -- Earthquake measuring 7.0 wrecks scenic mountain town of Lijiang in Yunnan, killing at least 304 people and injuring more than 16,000. • April 1990 -- Earthquake measuring 6.9 kills 126 people in northwestern Qinghai province. • November 1988 -- Earthquake measuring 7.6 devastates remote areas in Yunnan, killing at least 730 people and destroying about 400,000 homes. • July 1976 -- At least 270,500 people die when an earthquake measuring 7.8 flattens the northern city of Tangshan.
