OAKLAND, Calif. - Earthquake survivor Julio Berumen has been flooded with donations, toys and get-well cards, but the 6-year-old boy still cries out for the one thing no one can give him: his mother.         She died within inches of him when the upper deck of the Nimitz freeway slammed down on their car in last week's earthquake.         Rescuers had to amputate Julio's right leg to free him from the wreckage. While Julio and his 8-year-old sister, Cathy, are recovering from their injuries, friends of the close-knit family are hoping the quake did not kill the children's bright spirits.         When Julio's first-grade teacher brought him a toy at the hospital this week, ``he started crying,'' said the teacher, Manuela Knight.         ``He was probably wondering, `Why is my teacher coming to see me and not my mother?' '' she said yesterday.         She said Julio was ``everybody's friend'' in her class - spunky, confident and obviously the product of a warm and supportive family.         ``I saw him Tuesday, and he's not the same little boy, but I hope his spirit comes back,'' she said.         When the quake struck, Julio and Cathy were riding home from the orthodontist with their mother, Petra Berumen, and a family friend, Yolanda Orozco. The Berumens' car was crushed by a concrete pillar when the double-decked Interstate 880 collapsed, trapping dozens of cars.         Berumen and Orozco were killed. Cathy escaped with head injuries. Julio was trapped, his legs pinned in the crumpled car.         Julio has been in surgery three times since the quake, and his sister underwent an eight-hour operation Wednesday for fractures in her skull and facial bones, said Steve Tiger, spokesman at Children's Hospital in Oakland.         Both children are in good condition, Tiger said.         Aided by relatives, their father, Pastor, has kept a vigil by their bedsides.         Strangers from around the country have sent Julio and Cathy cash, checks, cards, toys and ``more stuffed animals than they would ever be able to use in a lifetime,'' Tiger said.         By yesterday, the Julio and Cathy Berumen Relief Fund set up at Oakland's Summit Bank had collected nearly $48,000.         The largest contribution was $3,000 from a couple in South Pasadena, Calif. One of the smallest was from Nissa Kauppila, 7, of Ferrysburg, Vt., who sent $2.10 and two little pins - a bunny and a frog - for Cathy and Julio.         ``I'm sorry you got cot in the earthquake,' '' Nissa printed in crooked block letters. ``I hope you feel well soon.''         The letters and donations pour in, hundreds each day. ``I'm having a hard time keeping my composure, opening these and reading them,'' bank worker Cindy Kyte said.         Another fund was set up at Donner School to help the family meet day-to-day expenses such as mortgage payments, Principal Catherine Syverson said.         The Berumens, born in Mexico, bought their first home - a small one-story house a few blocks from the school - just 2 1/2 months ago. Friends say their lives revolved around their children.         Even with the death of his wife, the first concern of Pastor Berumen, a construction worker, is Julio and Cathy.         ``At the moment he has to concentrate all his energy on his children. He doesn't even have time to deal with his wife's death yet,'' Tiger said. ``He does want to get out a `thank you' to everyone who has helped. But his concentration is elsewhere right now.''    ----------    JULIO FUND    ----------    - Contributions to the Julio and Cathy Berumen Relief Fund can be sent care of Summit Bank, 2969 Broadway, Oakland, Calif. 94612    - Contributions to the family fund set up by Downer Elementary School can be sent to Mechanics Bank, 3170 Hilltop Mall Road, Richmond, Calif. 9480
