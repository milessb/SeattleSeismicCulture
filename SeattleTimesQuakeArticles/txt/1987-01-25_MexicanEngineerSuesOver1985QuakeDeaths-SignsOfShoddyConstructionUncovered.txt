MEXICO CITY _ Several minutes after Raul Perez Pereyra left home on the morning of Sept. 19, 1985, his apartment building collapsed during the most devastating earthquake ever to hit Mexico City.         Perez leaped from his car two blocks away and charged through clouds of dust onto the massive heap of rubble. He wildly tore at chunks of cement, throwing them aside, screaming for his wife, daughter and two grandchildren, who were buried beneath the remains of the 12-story building.         By the time Perez's family members were found, they were dead, along with 118 other residents of the building. Like many relatives of the more than 10,000 earthquake victims, Perez has played the horrible scene over and over in his mind, but the 55-year-old civil engineer has done so with a professional eye.         Two weeks after the quake, Perez, who for 30 years has designed tall buildings in Mexico, recalled how easy it had been to remove chunks of cement from the collapsed building, how they seemed to crumble in his hands, and how the tangled steel bars gave way with little effort.         ``There was nothing at all to the building,'' he said, his voice wavering with anger.         This month, Perez will get a chance to tell his tale in court. Over the last year, he has worked every day collecting evidence to support his claim that the Tehuantepac apartment complex was unsafe. As a result of his efforts, two architects who designed and supervised the construction of the building in 1978 have been charged with manslaughter.         The Perez case has become something of a cause celebre among many Mexico City residents. The engineer's battle to ferret out evidence from the monolithic city bureaucracy has been chronicled by the press here, and he has been widely quoted castigating corrupt practices that many see as endemic to Mexican government.         Despite frequent allegations from citizens and experts that many injuries and deaths in the earthquake were a result of shoddy construction and poor enforcement of building codes, the Perez case has been the only prosecution so far.         The government's seemingly laggard pace in investigating negligence charges has led some residents to level accusations of a cover-up.         Last November, hundreds of city residents blocked a downtown street for five hours before being granted a meeting with an official from the attorney general's office. The protesters, seeking action on their case, represented survivors of the government-owned Nuevo Leon apartment building in the Tehuantepac complex, which collapsed and left 472 dead.         ``The government has tried to block us every step of the way,'' said Victoria Guillen, a survivor of the accident who has filed a suit similar to the Perez case. ``We have proof that for years before the earthquake we told the government again and again that our building was unsafe. They did nothing.''         More than 1,000 buildings collapsed in the 1985 disaster. Of the estimated 20 million square feet of downtown office space destroyed by the quake, about 12 million belonged to the government.         The government has declined to reply publicly to negligence and corruption charges. But an array of experts who studied the quake damage claim the widespread destruction was more a result of the severity of the quake than any other factor.         ``The phenomenon would have provoked the same damage in any foreign city,'' said Leopoldo Lieberman, president of the National Construction Industry Chamber of Commerce.         Nonetheless, a committee appointed by President Miguel de la Madrid shortly after the quake completed work on a new building code last month. The draft, now under review, would create more stringent requirements for materials such as concrete and reinforcing steel.         One of the committee members, Roberto Meli, assistant director of the Engineering Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, acknowledged that corruption was a problem in the permitting of city construction.         ``I can't say it doesn't happen,'' Meli said. ``It's one of the things we addressed in the new code.''         The designers of Perez's Tehuantepac building, Albelardo Meneses Vara and Maz Tenembaum Rosenfeld, face up to 40 years in prison if they are found guilty of having ``professional responsibility'' for the accident, as Perez's lawsuit charges. The suit seeks no monetary damages.         Perez claims that the architects who built the Tehuantepac complex were originally denied a building permit. But he said they were granted permission to build several days later.         ``I have seen it so many times in my work,'' Perez said. ``If you want to cut costs, if you want to use  3/8-inch bars instead of 1 1/2-inch steel bars, just bribe someone in the government.         ``I want someone to pay for that. I want them all to pay.'
