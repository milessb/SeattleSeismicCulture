LENINAKAN, U.S.S.R. - Bells tolled and mournful chants filled the streets today as Armenia marked the one-year anniversary of the earthquake that killed at least 25,000 people.         Many families face another bitter winter in tents because reconstruction work has been so slow.        In this mountain city hit hardest by the quake, officials stopped the big town clock forever at 11:41, the minute disaster struck Dec. 7, 1988.        ``If only it could all have been a dream, and we could wake up and have everyone here again,'' Armenian poet Maro Marzarian told a crowd of several hundred gathered to dedicate a memorial to Leninakan's victims.        In a cemetery just outside town, hundreds of families gathered at grave sites, some sobbing, others in stony silence. Among the many graves of the earthquake victims were plots for the remains of unidentifiable corpses, with markers reading only ``238 woman'' or ``453 child.''        ``Your soul hurts so much you just can't express it,'' said Lilia Stepanian, 25, whose brother, Zillik, and his family were crushed to death in their apartment.        She said Zillik's 3-year-old daughter could be heard crying from the ruins of the house but rescuers could not reach her.        ``And the people left alive have such a hard time,'' Stepanian said. She and her mother have moved to the Armenian capital, Yerevan, until housing can be built for them in Leninakan. They don't expect that any time soon.        The earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale killed at least 25,000 people and left 500,000 people homeless.        A year later, 20,000 people are still missing, according to the relief agency Search.         The town of Spitak was leveled. Kirovakan and some 300 villages were shattered.        In Leninakan alone - then Armenia's second-largest city with 235,000 people - the quake destroyed 99 nine-story apartment buildings, 10 schools and every factory, officials said.          The Soviet press said today the lack of progress and bad planning are a scandal.        The reconstruction master plan calls for all the damage to be rebuilt by December next year. But it has already been dismissed as hopelessly over-optimistic. Komsomolskaya Pravda said only 170,000 square yards of housing had been built so far, compared with the two million called for in the plan.        The bad planning has been exacerbated by an economic blockade of Armenia by neighboring Azerbaijan. The two republics have a longstanding dispute over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.        The Moscow News weekly said the blockade, which stopped all building materials reaching the earthquake zone for five weeks in the summer, had cost the Spitak region $32 million.Caption:  PHOTOAP, 1988: A SOLDIER ON RESCUE DUTY IN SPITAK, ARMENIA, TAKES A BREAK.
