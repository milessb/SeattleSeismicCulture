A "Movers and Shakers" earthquake education-and-preparedness program is being offered free by State Farm Insurance to any interested school.     The program is designed for use in kindergarten through high school and includes a lesson plan, a preparedness video, posters and activity sheets, plans for assembling a survival kit and after-quake communications with family members.     More than 2,000 copies of the program have been distributed to schools in Washington since the program was introduced in 1992.     They are available by contacting any State Farm agent or telephoning the company's regional public-affairs office, 360-786-6403
