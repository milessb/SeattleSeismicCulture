MOSCOW _ A powerful earthquake struck the Soviet Central Asian republic of Tadzhikistan last night, killing an undisclosed number of people and destroying homes and factories, the government newspaper Izvestia said today        In a report from the Tadzhik capital of Dushanbe, the newspaper said three towns in the republic, including the city of Leninabad with a population of 125,000, were hit by seven successive tremors.        Soviet officials said the main quake measured 6.1 points on the Richter scale, indicating it was the Soviet Union's strongest since 1976, when the neighboring republic of Uzbekistan was hit.        The quake registered 8 points on the 12-point Soviet scale, a measurement which the official Soviet encyclopedia describes as powerful enough to overturn monuments and ruin houses.        The quake caused landslides, destroyed roads and reduced clay houses to rubble, the officials said. Izvestia said the government had ordered emergency measures to deal with the aftermath.        In line with Soviet policy on natural disasters, no official death tally was given. However, both Izvestia and the official news agency Tass used the term ``loss of life,'' and Tass said the ruling Communist Party's Central Committee and the Soviet government had sent their condolences to the families of the dead, a high-level response that would normally be sent only in the case of many deaths and much damage.        The quake occurred nearly a month after the first of two quakes hit Mexico City, killing more than 7,000 people.        A Soviet state telephone company spokeswoman in Moscow told Reuters last night's earthquake had severed lines to Leninabad.        Izvestia said the quake's epicenter was at Kayrakkum, a town of 32,000 people 40 miles east of Leninabad.        ``The elements caused the destruction of industrial buildings and homes and there was loss of life,'' the newspaper said.        Tass also said the capital of Uzbekistan, Tashkent, the Soviet Union's fourth-largest city with more than 1.9 million people, was struck by a tremor measuring 5 points on the Soviet scale, which the encyclopedia describes as ``strong.'' (Tashkent, a sister city of Seattle's since 1972, suffered severe damage in a 1966 earthquake).        The agency gave no details of damage. Smaller quakes were recorded in the ancient Uzbek city of Samarkand and in other Tadzhik towns including Dushanbe itself, the agency said.        Izvestia said the main quake destroyed a hospital at Gafyrov, just south of Kayrakkum, but staff and patients had already evacuated it.        It said a sharp drop in temperature and unseasonal snowfall had alerted local authorities to the likelihood of a quake.        Tadzhikistan, a republic noted for its cotton plantations, silk mills and tractor plants, borders Afghanistan, China, Pakistan and India. Previous tremors were reported in the republic in May, August and September this year.        The Soviet Union's last earthquake of similar proportions occurred in 1976, when a tremor in the Uzbek township of Gazli was officially reported to have left 10,000 people homeless. Casualty figures were not given.        The most serious earthquakes in the country since World War II struck in 1948, when the city of Ashkhabad in the republic of Turkmenistan was destroyed, and in 1966, when there was massive damage in Tashkent.        The frequency of quakes in the central Asian republics has led Soviet architects to try to design buildings able to resist strong shocks. Many private homes are weak, however, because they are made of clay.Caption:  MAPED WALKER / SEATTLE TIMES (MAP SHOWING U.S.S.R WITH SURROUNDING NATIONS AND EARTHQUAKE EPICENTER)
