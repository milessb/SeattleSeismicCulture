An emergency worker in an earthquake-rescue class rappels past a window during a simulated rescue at Fort Steilacoom Park in Pierce County yesterday. Twenty-four rescue workers from fire and police departments in Pierce and King counties this week are being trained in classrooms and at a ruined building at the park. The earthquake-rescue course is one of only a few in the nation that offers training in a collapsed building. Story on B1Caption:  PHOTOTOM REESE / SEATTLE TIMES
