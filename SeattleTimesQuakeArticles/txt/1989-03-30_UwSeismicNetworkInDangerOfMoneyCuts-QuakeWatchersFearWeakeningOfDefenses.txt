Clusters of tiny earthquakes, mostly too small to be felt, are continuing beneath Western Washington, even during the lull after a cluster of larger quakes during the first 10 weeks of the year.         ``We're not sure how to interpret them, but there is a feeling that we may be moving into a period of increased seismic activity,'' said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University of Washington seismology laboratory.         If so, it's happening at a time when the UW's statewide network of seismic instruments is threatened by money problems.         The network, financed almost entirely by the federal government, has lost about 30 percent of its budget in the past several years, and more cuts are feared.         ``We live in earthquake country, and the UW's network is our first line of defense,'' said state Rep. Dick Nelson, D-Seattle, who is lobbying fellow legislators to allocate state money for the network.         The recent swarms of tiny quakes include rapid-fire clusters beneath Mount Hood on March 10 and Mount Rainier March 19. There were also a couple of swarms east of Lake Washington about 10 days ago. One continued for two hours, long enough for UW crews to rush instruments to the area.         The largest of the Eastside quakes was 2.2 on the Richter scale; there were no reports that anyone felt them, Jonientz-Trisler said. Even Mount St. Helens, which has not erupted for more than two years, experiences an occasional volcanic quake.         Earthquake swarms, by themselves, are not unusual or alarming in this area, even those that occur near dormant volcanoes. Unlike the earthquake clusters beneath Mount St. Helens that increased rapidly before the eruption, the recent swarms ran their course and then disappeared.         But the swarms plus the 17 earthquakes strong enough to be felt since the first of the year ``are making people a little cautious,'' Jonientz-Trisler said.         ``When people come in Monday morning they leaf through the records to see what happened over the weekend'' during hours when the lab was closed but instruments were operating, she said.         The UW has asked the state for $150,000 over the next two years to help operate the system and upgrade its seismology laboratory's ability to monitor earthquakes and relay information to state agencies.         The seismology lab, which was operating 24 hours a day at the time of the Mount St. Helens eruption in the early 1980s, now operates from 8 to 5 Monday through Friday. When earthquakes occur at night or on weekends, the information is recorded, but there is a delay in passing it to government agencies.         Nelson said the state provides only 3 percent of the money to operate the seismic network. The U.S. Geological Survey and Department of Energy pay the rest. The annual budget is about $500,000, down from $700,000 a few years ago.         Steve Malone, a research geophysicist at the UW, says that among states in seismic areas, Washington makes one of the smallest contributions to monitoring its own earthquakes.         When the Department of Energy in 1987 canceled its investigation of Hanford as a site for permanent disposal of radioactive waste, it cut back its contribution to the seismic network.         That resulted in the closing of 14 of 42 stations in Eastern Washington. The network still has about 100 stations statewide and in the Oregon Cascades. Oregon does not have its own seismic network.         Despite the apparent clustering of earthquakes in Western Washington, many seismologists don't feel there is a connection between earthquakes that occur over a wide area.         ``The general feeling is that there is no physical way that one earthquake can influence another,'' Malone said. ``But some feel that periods of increased activity may be due to increased stress over a large area.''         One idea is that the pushing and pulling of tectonic plates could change, increasing stresses in the Pacific Northwest. Most geologists believe that earthquakes and volcanoes in the Pacific Northwest are a result of a slab of ocean bottom, known as the Juan de Fuca Plate, thrusting beneath the continental shelf.         Not much is known about the rate at which the plate moves, but it is believed to be about an inch a year. If the movement speeded up, it could increase earth stresses all over the Pacific Northwest.         There was speculation in the early 1980s that the Cascades might be entering a period of increased earthquake and volcanic activity. Mount Baker abruptly increased its heat output in 1975. Mount St. Helens erupted in May 1980, and swarms of tiny quakes beneath Mount Hood in July 1980 prompted the Geological Survey to issue a ``volcanic hazard watch'' that stayed in effect for about a month.         Geologists wondered if the Cascade volcanoes might be heading for a repeat of a five-year period in the 1840s, when Mount Baker, Mount St. Helens and Mount Hood were all erupting at the same time. In addition, there is an ash layer laid down by Mount Rainier that could have occurred in the same period.         ``The university seismic network played an important role in adding to our understanding of volcanoes when Mount St. Helens erupted,''  Nelson said. ``I believe we need to do whatever we can to keep it operating and, perhaps, improve our ability to predict earthquakes.'Caption:  PHOTOPETER LIDDELL / SEATTLE TIMES: STEVE MALONE, A RESEARCH GEOPHYSICIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, MAKES PENCILED NOTATIONS ON A DRUM THAT RECORDS SEISMIC ACTIVITY AT THE CRITERION STATION IN EASTERN OREGON.
