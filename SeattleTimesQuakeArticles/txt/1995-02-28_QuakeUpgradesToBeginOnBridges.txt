SEATTLE - King County will embark on a $20 million, 12-year plan to upgrade 115 county bridges towithstand major earthquakes.     The plan, approved recently by the Metropolitan King County Council, grew out of an earthquake-preparedness study begun in 1992.     Councilman Bruce Laing, noting that nearly two-thirds of the county's bridges were built before 1960, called the project a timely one.     Bridges high on the list for renovation include the Novelty and Tolt River bridges in Snoqualmie
