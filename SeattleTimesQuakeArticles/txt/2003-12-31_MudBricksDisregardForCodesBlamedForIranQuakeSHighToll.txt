TEHRAN â€” Poor design, primitive materials and widely ignored building codes were prime causes of the high death rate in the Bam earthquake, Iranian officials and foreign experts said yesterday. Iran's building codes have been tightened after quakes in recent decades, but officials and independent scientists say enforcement is woefully inadequate. "There are building codes here but they are not followed. The laws are there, but only in theory. No one pays any attention. No authorities control construction," said Bahram Akasheh, geophysics professor at Tehran University. President Mohammad Khatami said anyone who had violated state codes would be punished. While Iranian officials keep a close eye on many aspects of daily life, there is little policing of construction. "I don't think there are any shortcomings with our policies and construction codes," said Mohsen Rezaei, secretary of Iran's powerful Expediency Council. "It is the construction managers who do not implement the codes. There is not enough supervision of construction and engineering." Fingers are also being pointed at the mud bricks common in towns such as Bam. They are cheap and popular because they keep houses cool in summer and warm in winter. But they crumble easily, suffocating many who survive the actual quake. "In Iran ... the houses are essentially made of dust," said Enzo Boschi, president of the National Institute of Geophysics in quake-prone Italy.
