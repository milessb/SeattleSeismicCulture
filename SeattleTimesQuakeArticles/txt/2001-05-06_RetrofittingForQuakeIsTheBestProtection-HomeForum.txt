Q: I'm thinking of having my 60-year-old house anchored to the foundation to prevent earthquake damage. But with all the news about how the "Big One" could be so much worse than our recent quake, I wonder how much protection anchoring really gives a house. Wouldn't a big quake destroy it anyway?       A:       "The wonderful news is that the really large type of earthquake that people worry about, called a subduction zone earthquake, would be (centered) in the Pacific Ocean, more than 100 miles from the Puget Sound area," says the Phinney Neighborhood Association's Roger Faris, who's an expert both in earthquakes and home retrofitting. This means that while such a quake would be very strong and perhaps two or three minutes long, "the total energy of a giant subduction-zone earthquake is distributed over a much larger region, so the actual ground motion in the Puget Sound area would be moderate." How moderate? "Similar to the kind of ground motion we experienced Feb. 28," Faris says. Also of concern is the shallower Seattle Fault, which runs from Bainbridge Island across Seattle to Issaquah. While it could generate stronger ground motion, it's active much less frequently than a subduction quake. Indeed, the Seattle Fault last rumbled 1,100 years ago; the last subduction-zone quake was but 300 years ago. The Seattle Fault's potential to cause serious shaking makes it "the kind that does require we retrofit our homes," Farris says, as does a  subduction-zone quake. "Wood-frame residential construction can survive strong ground motion if it's well connected to the foundation," Faris says, which means a complete and correct retrofit. And that involves more than simply anchoring it to the foundation. The nonprofit Phinney Neighborhood Association conducts two-hour retrofit classes throughout the region. Homeowners learn the basics so they can do the work themselves or know what to look for when hiring others. Cost is $10 per person; $5 for a second household member. Call 206-382-2159. Also available at that number is information on a six-hour course for contractors.       Q: Once we're married, my fianc&eacute;             wants me to add his name to my home's title, which I'm willing to do if it doesn't somehow cause problems. What are the pros and cons of doing this? I have children (who are school age) and he doesn't.       A:       What your fianc&eacute; is proposing is "a uniquely bad idea," says family-law attorney Helene Ellenbogen, of Wershow &amp; Ellenbogen. And it's not just because a high percentage of repeat marriages end in divorce. If you simply add him to the title (via a quit claim), that gives him part ownership of your house, but no financial responsibility for the mortgage. To do that, you must refinance and put him on the deed of trust. Say you do both. Then you die without a will. In adding him to the title you've "given away 50 percent of the equity in the house." You keep the other half, but with your death he inherits half of your half. The result: your children together inherit just one-quarter of their family home. Or say you eventually need to tap your home's equity to put your kids through college. If the marriage breaks apart in the meantime, your new spouse leaves with a major chunk of that. Yet another scenario: you're together, but he forbids getting a home-equity loan. A better approach is to have an attorney draft a prenuptial agreement that takes into account the assets of both of you, outlining whether they'll be shared or kept separate. Within this framework, you may indeed decide to share your home's value--but in a way that doesn't potentially harm your family. "Most people," says Ellenbogen, "have the idea that prenuptial agreements are a cynical way of holding onto your money to the detriment of your spouse, and that's just not true. "An agreement is a financially responsible way of weighing the needs and responsibilities regarding the children with the needs of the subsequent spouse." Finally, Ellenbogen has this advice: if your fianc&eacute; is pushing you to put him on the title, you "might want to take a very close look at why. Marriages made in heaven do not require large gifts to the incoming spouse."       Q: My mother has owned a piece of undeveloped Vashon Island property since 1967. She recently hired a septic designer, who reports that the ground won't support an approved septic system. Without one, what other options does my mother have for this land?       A:       Situations like this are exactly why George Thurtle, a land broker with John L. Scott, does not recommend individuals buy rural land as a long-term investment. The land can be rezoned in the interim. Or new environmental regulations can restrict usage. Or health-department rules, which cover waste disposal, can change. In your mother's case, Thurtle says that without an approved septic system, the land is unbuildable. But before giving up, he suggests you ask the health department, now officially called Public Health-Seattle &amp; King County, for a variance to install a reactor-type septic system. While they're not approved locally, these systems have proven effective elsewhere, he says. Alternately, you could investigate whether a neighbor would allow your mother to purchase an off-site drain-field easement. (Again, that would require permission from the health department.) Otherwise, here are your mother's choices: ** Hold the land even longer and hope septic rules change. ** Donate it and get a tax break. ** Or ask if the government might want to buy it. "In some cases municipalities are willing to purchase property like this if it's next to a stream or would have any potential community value," Thurtle says.
