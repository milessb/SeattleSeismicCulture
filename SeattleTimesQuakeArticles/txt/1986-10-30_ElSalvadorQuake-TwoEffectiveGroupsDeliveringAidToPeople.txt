Due to recent publicity about the role of the Salvadoran government in distributing aid to earthquake victims, many people are wondering about the best way to send help to the people of El Salvador.     There are several pre-existing organizations which have been very effective in getting medical supplies directly to the victims of the Salvadoran civil war, and which are airlifting aid to San Salvador for victims of the earthquake. Two of these are:     1. Medical Aid for El Salvador, 6030 Wilshire Blvd. #200, Los Angeles, Calif. 90036, (213) 937-3596.     2. NEST Foundation (formerly New El Salvador Today), P.O. Box 4762, Berkeley, Calif. 94704, (415) 549-2114. Checks should be made payable to NEST/Disaster Relief Fund.     I do not mean by this to cast aspersions on any other relief organizations. I am sure that many others will help effectively. But these two groups have had great success in getting help directly to the people in need, and I believe your readers deserve to know this.     - R.E.
