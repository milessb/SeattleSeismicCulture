LOS ANGELES - While many residents of this earthquake-stricken area are seriously thinking of moving, the city's most famous industry is staying put: After all, studio executives say, Hollywood is Hollywood     The major movie studios escaped serious damage in Monday's earthquake and the aftershocks that followed and by Thursday, while many areas were still grappling with the effects of the quake, it was business as usual on the movie lots.     "Hollywood has been here since shortly after the turn of the century and it's survived earthquakes, floods and fires, so why move," said one studio executive.     "Besides, relocating a studio would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, not to mention lost production time. It's just not a feasible alternative," said the executive, who asked not to be identified.     Studio officials said that at most, Monday's quake put production schedules back by a day or two.     "Everybody just kind of lost a day," said a spokesman for Paramount Pictures Corp in Hollywood.     At Sony Pictures Entertainment in Culver City, the only damage was caused by a copying machine that crashed through a wall and several toppled filing cabinets.     "We were up and running by Tuesday," a Sony spokesman said.     Sony is the `new kid on the block' in Hollywood, opening its TriStar and Columbia Pictures studios in 1990.     But the Sony spokesman said there had never been any talk of relocating. "It's just never come up. No one's even thought about it."           Hollywood's determined, stay-put-at-all-costs attitude toward earthquakes and other natural disasters was exemplified by a story reported by Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd.     According to Archerd, comedian Bill Cosby was in New York Wednesday, speaking on the telephone to comedy writer Mike Milligan in Los Angeles when a 5.1 magnitude aftershock struck.     "What was that thumping noise?" Cosby asked.     "That was my knees," Milligan was reported to have said.     "Why don't you leave L.A.?" Cosby continued.     "What!" said Milligan, "And give up show biz!
