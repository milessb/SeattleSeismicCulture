BRIER - Four Seattle-area residents who survived a devastating earthquake in Costa Rica last week may help scientific research of tidal waves.      The four, including two Brier teenagers, may have seen a rare tsunami in the Central American country, according to  Eddie Bernard, a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Seattle.      Bernard said tsunamis, tidal waves typically produced by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, are rare in the Atlantic Ocean. Most tsunamis occur in the Pacific Ocean, where tectonic plates brushing against each other produce violent earthquakes.    "We knew there had been a tsunami. We had heard rumors, but we didn't have an eyewitness account," said Bernard, director of the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory at Sand Point in Seattle.         The four people, Andi Piper, Jill Nissen, her brother Jeff and his wife, Francine Nissen, were on a beach near the Caribbean port city of Puerto Limon when the earthquake, measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale, shook the country.      The Brier teenagers, Piper and Jill Nissen, said that after the quake hit, the ocean retreated, exposing a coral reef for more than a mile. The water then rushed back in, covering the beach in a furious tide.      Piper, 16, has recovered from a harrowing five-day odyssey after the earthquake and said she would be happy to share what she saw at the beach.      Their observations, Bernard said, may help persuade Costa Rican officials to educate citizens about tsunamis or get them to install an early-warning system.       Frank  Gonzalez, who is involved in a tsunami-research project for NOAA, said eyewitness accounts provide greater understanding of tidal waves.      Gonzalez said Valparaiso, Chile, is the only city in the Western Hemisphere that has an early-warning system for tsunamis as part of a pilot program sponsored by NOAA. Mexico is interested in installing a similar system along its Pacific coast, he said.      Detecting tsunamis before they reach shore could save lives and decrease economic losses, Gonzalez said.      According to NOAA figures, in the last 10 years six tsunamis in the Pacific have claimed 5,646 lives.      Bernard said Piper and her friends were lucky to have gotten off the beach in time.
