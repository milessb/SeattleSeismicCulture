As we grieve for the plight of our Armenian brothers and sisters we are witnessing, on the other hand, a new level of world cooperation and sympathy that is quite moving. The fact that Russian authorities have been willing to cross ideological barriers to ask for assistance, and the fact that the Western world is reaching generously to the victims and is cooperating with Soviets to rescue and assist the victims is indeed a moving experience and a hopeful sign. Could this calamity be a providen ce, teaching us world peace and unity is possible? And that human beings are not hopelessly selfish and aggressive? And world relationships based on cooperation and unity are attainable    - Saba Mahanian, Bellevue
