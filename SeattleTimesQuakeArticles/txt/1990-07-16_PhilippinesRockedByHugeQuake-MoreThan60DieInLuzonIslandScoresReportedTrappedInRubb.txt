MANILA, Philippines - A major earthquake rocked Manila and surrounding Luzon island this afternoon, inflicting serious damage. Officials reported at least 67 people killed, most when a six-story college building north of Manila collapsed.        Scores more were believed trapped under the rubble of crumbled buildings, including 150 reportedly trapped in the Hyatt Hotel in the mountain resort of Baguio.        The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., registered the quake at 7.7 on the Richter scale. There were scores of aftershocks.        In Manila, numerous buildings were damaged, and office workers rushed into the streets in panic. There were stampedes at many theaters. At the Manila Hotel, a luxury hotel on Manila Bay, hundreds of guests were evacuated into the streets.        Overall, the human toll in the capital was limited. Elsewhere on Luzon, however, there was widespread damage and there were many casualties. A number of towns and cities were without power.        At least 41 people were killed in the provincial capital of Cabanatuan City, many of them at Philippine Christian College where the six-story building collapsed in the quake. Hundreds of students were unaccounted for.        The city of more than 80,000 is 60 miles north of Manila and was near the epicenter.        In Baguio, 110 miles north of Manila, portions of several luxury hotels collapsed. The Manila radio station DZRH said 150 people were trapped in the Hyatt Hotel. A woman who identified herself as a public-relations officer of the hotel said most of those trapped were in the casino.        The radio station said Baguio hospitals are filled with injured, most of them foreigners.        Officials in Baguio also said a public market collapsed.        Air Force Master Sgt. Dan Fuller, reached by telephone at the U.S.-run Camp John Hay in Baguio, said the city was without electricity and that damage was widespread.        ``We're without power,'' he said. ``We've had structural damage here on base. We do have seven buildings down downtown which as far as we know they are completely fallen in.''  He said U.S. personnel assisted in rescue efforts.          DZRH quoted an affiliate station as saying a church in the northern province of Ilocos Sur collapsed.        A radio station in Dagupan, 100 miles north of Manila, said 13 people were killed there, but the report could not be confirmed. It said all died in stampedes as panic-stricken people tried to flee a movie theater and schools.        President Corazon Aquino ordered the military to launch an islandwide rescue operation. Her spokesman, Adolf Azcuna, said the president was meeting senators in her office when the quake struck and took cover under a table.        A quake measured at 7.8 struck the Philippines in 1976, killing 8,000 people. Most of them died in a tidal wave which struck the southern island of Mindanao.        The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one digit represents a tenfold increase of magnitude. A quake of magnitude 7 is capable of widespread, heavy damage.        The quake that struck Iran on June 21, which was measured at between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter scale, killed 40,000 people, injured another 60,000 and left half a million homeless.Caption:  PHOTO MAPAP: A SECURITY GUARD INSPECTS A VAN CRUSHED BY A FALLEN CONCRETE PILAR DURING THE EARTHQUAKE IN MANILA.AP: WORKERS FLEE FROM AN OFFICE BUILDING IN THE PHILIPPINE CAPITAL OF MANILA AFTER A MASSIVE QUAKE STRUCK LUZON ISLAND.AP: PHILIPPINES (A MAP OF THE PHILIPPINES POINTING THE AREA THAT WAS STRUCK BY EARTHQUAKE) (MAP NOT AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY
