LAS VEGAS - Awakening to an early morning earthquake, then playing golf in 40-mph winds didn't rattle Jim Furyk.    Defending champion and two-time winner of the Las Vegas Invitational, Furyk shot a steady 1-under-par 71 yesterday to open a three-shot lead.    Furyk pulled out of a three-way tie at the top and went to 23 under through four rounds of the five-day event. Jonathan Kaye began the day one shot off the lead and moved into second alone with a 73.    "My short game was real sound; it bailed me out," said Furyk, who made four short birdie putts to overcome one bogey and a double-bogey.    Although an earthquake, which was centered 150 miles to the west in California, jolted many in the early morning hours, neither Furyk nor Kaye lost much sleep.    "It was pretty crazy; I'm from the East and I'm not used to that," Furyk said. "But I was groggy and just went back to sleep."     The shaking didn't bother Kaye a bit.    "I slept through it," he said. Other tournaments      --  Mark O'Meara faces Colin Montgomerie in today's final in World Match Play in Virginia Water, England.
