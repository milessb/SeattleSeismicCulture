Thank you for publishing the "How to be Prepared" page in Tuesday's Times. However, I would like to point out that your list of preparations makes scant mention of one of our greatest resources in a time of disaster - our neighbors     With the help of personnel from the City of Seattle Division of Emergency Management we are working to organize "neighborhood preparedness" - dividing our area of about 30 homes into response teams to assume emergency duties, including first aid, utility shut-off, and child care during a disaster.      We hope to be ready to pool our resources and help care for one another, should a situation occur where we are without government services for two or three days.      I encourage other neighborhoods to contact LuAn Johnson, SDART program manager of the City of Seattle Department of Administrative Services, for assistance in organizing a disaster-response team.     Learning how to work with our neighbors before a crisis occurs may be the most valuable earthquake preparedness any family can have. Louise McAllister Seattl
