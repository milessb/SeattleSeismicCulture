MEXICO CITY (UPI) _ Two months after two major earthquakes devastated parts of the capital, thousands of homeless remained camped in city parks yesterday and badly damaged buildings tottered dangerously above city streets        The tourism sector has only partially recovered from a drastic drop in business that followed two major quakes Sept. 19 and 20. The government has said more than 7,000 people died, but independent estimates have placed the number at 20,000.        Officials have blamed exaggerated publicity for scaring away tourists.        About 10,000 buildings either collapsed or were irreversibly damaged by the quakes, private observers say.        Some areas of Mexico City were virtually unaffected.        But two months after the devastation, tent camps still flourish in dozens of neighborhood parks, and 80 government-run shelters remain open.        Almost 100,000 people are awaiting the fulfillment of government promises to provide them with new homes, material to rebuild their homes or special loans to purchase property.        City government spokesmen said plans for reconstruction _ the first phase of which is expected to cost $1 billion and include construction of both private and government buildings _ may have to be postponed for up to two years.        Meanwhile, hundreds of damaged buildings loom over sidewalks, threatening to collapse before government workers can complete demolition plans.        Most ruptured water lines have been repaired, but homes in several neighborhoods, especially in poorer areas, are still without running water.
