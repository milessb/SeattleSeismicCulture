WASHINGTON - At a time when it's tough to find federal dollars to pay for any new programs, one sure key to the Treasury survives: natural disasters.        With more than $5 billion appropriated so far, Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake set new records in federal disaster relief.        Such aid is a burden that Americans rarely question. ``It's in the American grain to express your sympathy for the plight of other people by wanting to pay for the repairs,'' said Kai Erikson, a Yale University sociologist who has studied disasters.        But as the enormous costs are assessed, the price of such massive aid has come into question in some circles.        ``Every nickel you are spending will come out of some other program's hide - education, child care, nutrition, the homeless, drugs, defense, you name it,'' Rep. Bob Traxler, D-Mich, told his House colleagues during the post-earthquake debate over disaster aid. ``If you want to say that the nation, because of the acts of God, has to take food out of children's mouths, that is your privilege.''        As California and the communities devastated by Hugo still struggle to recover, skeptical voices are in a minority. Rep. Bob Livingston, D-La., is one of the few congressmen who openly question how much the government can and should spend every time disaster hits.        ``People look to the federal treasury to make them whole. I don't think the federal treasury and the American taxpayer has the money to do that,'' he said.        Criticism of growing federal involvement in disaster relief highlights issues that are painful to confront, given the context of human misery, but demand consideration by policy-makers and the public.        Among them:        --  Should the federal government be the ``insurer of last resort'' for communities damaged in natural disasters?        --  Should the government, through its relief programs, in effect reward people for living in risk-prone areas?        --  What are victims' expectations of federal relief? Are they reasonable?        --  Given the budget deficit, should there be limits to federal disaster aid?        ``It's short-sighted to be penny-pinching about disaster relief,'' argued Fred Keeley, a county supervisor in Santa Cruz, Calif. where the Oct. 17 earthquake demolished the downtown business district. ``The longer it takes for a community to recover, the more government loses out - in productivity and revenues.        ``If you leave a South Carolina, a Santa Cruz, a San Francisco in a condition of economic weakness, then that community is not a healthy vital participant in a regional economy or a state economy or the national economy.''        What was once an ad hoc approach to disaster has evolved into a burgeoning bureaucracy since 1950, when Congress passed the first disaster law providing a permanent mechanism for federal response, now led by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).        Now, when disaster strikes, the federal government responds with personnel, machinery and most of all, money.        The government routinely spends billions of dollars annually to help communities recover from disasters ranging from hurricanes and floods to fires and sewer explosions.        In the past decade, 241 communities have been declared major disaster areas by the president, according to FEMA.        The designation makes local communities, states and individual victims eligible for a wide range of federal aid from loans and grants to debris removal and highway and bridge reconstruction.        During that 10-year period, FEMA distributed about $2 billion in relief money to state and local governments and individual victims, excluding Hugo and the California quake.        Other federal agencies, including the Agriculture Department, the Small Business Administration, the Department of Education, the Federal Highway Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers, spent more than $40 billion since 1979 on grants and loans for lost crops, repairs to schools, homes and businesses, reconstruction of roads and bridges and waterway cleanup.        The sheer size of this federal effort - coupled with the rising expectations of some victims - alarms Livingston.        ``We have to draw the line,'' he said. ``We have to do what we can afford to do to help those people, but we can't be the insurance policy of end resort for everybody that simply feels they've been wronged by Mother Nature.''        But disaster victims and local officials in devastated communities now protest loudly - as in South Carolina and in California - if massive federal aid is not immediately supplied.        The attitude of local officials was perhaps best illustrated by San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos' reaction when reporters asked him what he expected from the federal officials after the earthquake hit his city. ``Damn right I want them to pay for everything,'' he said. ``That's what they owe us, and that's what I'm going to ask them to do.''        Within a week, Congress responded with a $4.15 billion disaster relief package - the largest in history - on top of $1.1 billion that had already been appropriated to cope with the damage Hurricane Hugo caused in North and South Carolina, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.        At one point during the wrangling after the California earthquake, Livingston even offered an amendment - a facetious one, he said - asking Congress to appropriate $5 billion for all hurricane damage in coastal Louisiana since 1900. Louisiana is no stranger to disasters - or aid. In the past decade, there have been 10 major disasters declared there.        ``My point was if you're going to help the earthquake victims and the hurricane victims, fine, but then let's not turn this into a grab bag,'' Livingston said. ``There are people all around this country who have suffered devastation from tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, mudslides, snowstorms who don't get royal treatment.''        ``The question is, who would you not pay for?'' said Claire Rubin, a research scientist at George Washington University who studies disaster recovery efforts. ``As Americans, I don't think we're willing to have thousands of unfortunate people put out on the street due to a natural hazard. It's just not politically acceptable.''        ``I don't know that expectation is the right word,'' said Kathryn Kidd, an instructor at the University of South Carolina who helped organize social-work students to counsel victims of Hurricane Hugo. ``These people are not asking for handouts. They're asking for assistance, for loans, for help in rebuilding.''        After Hurricane Hugo left her mobile home unlivable, the federal government sent Robin Mouzon of Greeleyville, S.C., a check for $1,000 to cover rent on temporary housing. Unfortunately, Hugo's devastation has made rentals hard to find in her rural community. So Mouzon is waiting now for the federal government to bring in trailers.        ``I don't think they owe me anything, '' she said. ``This was a natural disaster. It wasn't caused by the federal government. It was caused by God. But they did say they would help.'Caption:  PHOTOAP: SUZANNE KLEINMAN CLIMBS THROUGH THE REMAINS OF HER EARTHQUAKE-WRECKED HOME IN SAN FRANCISCO.AP: PARTS OF A BUILDING CLOG A CHARLESTON, S.C., STREET THE MORNING AFTER HURRICANE HUGO PASSED THROUGH
