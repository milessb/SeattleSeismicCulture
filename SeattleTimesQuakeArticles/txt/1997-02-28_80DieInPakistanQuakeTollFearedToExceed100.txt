ISLAMABAD, Pakistan  - A powerful earthquake shook southwestern Pakistan for nearly one minute today, toppling homes and killing at least 80 people.    Dozens of others were injured when their homes caved in, government officials said.    The 7.3-magnitude quake struck near Quetta, about 400 miles southwest of Islamabad.   The  city of about 200,000 is the capital of Pakistan's least-populated province, Baluchistan.    Ambulance workers said they feared the death toll could surpass 100.    As many as 60 may have died in Harnai, a village just 30 miles away from the quake's epicenter, they said.    Most of the damage was in the Sibi area, where Harnai is located. The area is a vast plain, and the population is scattered throughout hundreds of small villages.
