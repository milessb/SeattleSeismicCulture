Puget Sound-area residents have received a few gentle reminders lately that they're living on a topsy-turvy little piece of the Earth's crust. First, Mount Baker shot a plume of steam hundreds of yards into the air over the weekend. Then a mild earthquake quivered yesterday afternoon about four miles beneath North Bend. "It's a wonderful place to live," said Bill Steele, seismology-lab coordinator at the University of Washington. "We are in a very dynamic region of the country, and part of the evidence of that dynamism is the earthquake and the active volcanoes." The column of steam off Mount Baker was not particularly unusual in that the mountain has several active steam vents, including the fumaroles that cranked out water vapor from Sherman Crater most of Sunday. The vapor quickly condensed in the cold air. "Quite a plume," Steele said. "It was quite impressive over the weekend. It was even spotted in Seattle because it was so clear." The mountain had no unusual earthquake activity to suggest it might be getting restless. Sherman Crater had a surge of gas and steam emissions in the mid-1970s, but the emissions declined and stabilized over the next two years, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Several small mudflows came from nearby glaciers, and the acidity of Baker Lake rose. The North Bend quake, which had a magnitude of 3.1, hit at 2:03 p.m. yesterday. It prompted several calls to the seismology lab and more than a dozen  responses to the lab's Web site. No damage was reported. The quake could be associated with the Seattle fault, which runs beneath Bainbridge Island, under Seattle and out toward Issaquah, Steele said.&nbsp; Quake information Details on the North Bend quake can be found online at http://spike .geophys.washington.edu /shake/0102142203/intensity.html.
