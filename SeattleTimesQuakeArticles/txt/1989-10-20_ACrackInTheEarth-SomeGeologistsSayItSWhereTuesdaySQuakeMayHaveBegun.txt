LOMA PRIETA, Calif. - This whole thing may have started at the Tranbarger house here.         The 4-foot-wide, 15-foot-deep, 250-yard-long gash in the earth ripped its way Tuesday to John and Freda Tranbarger's front porch in the Santa Cruz Mountains. From there, geologists believe, the subterranean force traveled outward at 7,000 miles an hour for hundreds of miles in all directions.         It was a catastrophic earthquake, registering 6.9 on the Richter scale.         Since the quake, hundreds of visitors have come to see the jagged wound in the earth. Most stand wordless before the trench, awed by the clear sign of the quake's power.         ``It's kind of a landmark right now,'' said Jeff Marshall, an earth-sciences student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He said the great opening was ``the most extensive ground rupture'' he had seen.         Tranbarger, a retired Lockheed Corp. engineer, described the fury of the quake: ``It sounded like the end of the world.''         ``It stopped for a second and then started again,'' Freda Tranbarger said. ``We couldn't even crawl without falling down.''         The Tranbargers said the force of the earthquake moved furniture, including the family's piano, and tossed them to the ground several times. After the quake they were stunned to see the hole.         Probably in shock, they immediately drew up lawn chairs and sat down to gawk.         ``I couldn't believe it,'' Freda said. ``It didn't seem possible. That's awesome - to look out suddenly and see that you've got a two-level'' lot.         Jean Olson of the U.S. Geological Survey said the Tranbargers' front yard was directly above the quake's epicenter. The gash in the earth only hinted at the geological turmoil below: The first, massive shock was quickly followed by one registering 5.9 and then, 15 minutes later, a third one that registered 5.2.         ``That's quite a surface crack,'' Olson said.          Other geologists said later, however, that the opening was probably not the epicenter. If it was, the huge crack would have been 30 miles long, with its width and depth consistent for the entire length, said David Schwartz, also with the U.S. Geological Survey.         Either way, the massive gap is significant because of its sheer size, the geologists said.         The gash stretches across Summit Road in front of the house, which is set on the side of Loma Prieta, a small mountain south of San Jose and northeast of Santa Cruz.         Miraculously, the Tranbargers' 80-year-old house survived intact, though nearly everything inside was destroyed. The Tranbargers, who have lived on Loma Prieta for 29 years, said the house still stood because it was bolted to its foundation.         They feel lucky having lost only their possessions, compared with those who lost their homes or their lives.         The Tranbargers' luck - and terror - continued yesterday, when several powerful aftershocks split the earth elsewhere.         Since Tuesday geologists have recorded more than 1,400 aftershocks in the Santa Cruz Mountains.         Some who were in the mountains yesterday told tales of horror.         ``I saw a deer fall into a hole that just opened up right under him,'' said Maria Shevin, 17. She and two friends rode into the mountains yesterday on dirt bikes for a night of adventurous camping.         As more stories of destruction circulated in the evacuation shelters of this remote region, many residents complained that they felt left out. They said San Francisco residents were hogging all the attention and getting the most help.         ``We haven't seen Dan Rather or Dan Quayle,'' said Ryan Moore, whose Santa Cruz home slid 100 feet down a mountain Tuesday - with Moore inside taking a nap. His parents watched in shock from the garage, which remained behind, as the house slipped away. Moore escaped with only cuts and bruises.         But despite the death and destruction, and the promise of more to come one day, few residents plan to leave.         What about the Tranbargers? Do they plan to leave their home, now that there is an earthquake epicenter in the front yard?         ``Heck no,'' said John Tranbarger. ``We like it here.'Caption:  PHOTOCRAIG FUJII / SEATTLE TIMES: A NEIGHBOR TAKES A CLOSE LOOK AT THE GIANT CRACK IN JOHN TRANBARGER'S YARD.
