Search crews at the site of a collapsed double-decker elevated highway worked through a presidential visit yesterday and vowed to toil through forecast rainstorms this weekend to recover more bodies of the dead        President Bush tried to encourage the searchers, who yesterday dug more than a dozen bodies from under tons of freeway concrete.        With the immediacy of Tuesday's catastrophic earthquake fading, attention was turning yesterday to the staggering cleanup job that lies ahead - a task to be measured in billions of dollars, uprooted lives and months of adjustment to a new landscape.        Damage estimates climbed hourly yesterday throughout the 75-mile-long region as scientists pinpointed the epicenter of the mammoth earthquake beneath a mountain creek.         So far, 54 bodies of quake victims have been recovered - 33 of them from the collapsed double-deck section of Interstate 880 in Oakland. Dozens remain listed as missing.        To make matters worse, rain was forecast for the area today, and temperatures in some areas could drop to the 40s. Authorities said that could hamper rescue efforts.        Rain also heightened the threat of additional landslides in the mountains north of Santa Cruz, where 60 homes already have been destroyed in Boulder Creek, a town of 6,800.         In a short visit yesterday, Bush walked over chunks of concrete beside the 1 1/4-mile crumpled stretch of Interstate 880, where scores of people were feared entombed and talked with rescue workers.        ``I am deeply moved by this, saddened in some ways, yet very stimulated by this team effort,'' the president said.         His trip down the block along the interstate was cut short because engineers would not let him go underneath the highway, fearing it might collapse.        Ironworker Joe Carter said the president asked him how his rescue crew felt.        ``I told him . . . we're beat, we're tired, but we're still going at it,'' Carter said. Bush ``let me know the eyes of the world are on us right now.''        Searchers have found 52 cars in the lower section of the Oakland freeway, but there may be more still buried in the rubble, California Highway Patrol Sgt. John Silva said. Authorities believe there are fewer than 30 cars remaining buried with bodies inside, he said.        ``You see a car that's crushed, a lot of debris, you usually find the people slumped over the steering wheel,'' said Alameda firefighter Matt Tunney, who spent the night helping remove five bodies.        ``I'd thought I'd seen everything. This is devastation, the worst disaster I've ever seen,'' he said.        Five psychologists are at the scene for the rescue workers.        Initially, authorities had estimated 253 people were buried - based on an assumption that cars stretched bumper to bumper on the stretch of crushed lower level. The third game of the World Series, which was scheduled to begin shortly after the quake struck, may have kept commuters by televisions rather than on freeways, they said.         The search for why the freeway collapsed - and who, if anybody, was responsible - continued yesterday.         Geologists said they had warned a governor's panel in 1982 that soil beneath the section of Oakland freeway that collapsed would probably turn to liquid in a big earthquake.        In addition, two structural engineers said yesterday that the elevated portion of Interstate 880 probably would not have fallen had its columns been reinforced with steel and concrete.        As the Bay Area tried to recover, aftershocks continued.        A moderate aftershock measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale struck near Santa Cruz at 5:50 p.m. yesterday,  according to the Seismographic Station at the University of California at Berkeley.        At 1:13 a.m. yesterday, an aftershock of magnitude 3.9 was centered about seven miles southwest of Los Gatos, Berkeley seismologists said. It was felt north and south of San Francisco.        More than 1,500 aftershocks have hit since Tuesday.        Scientists roaming through mountains southeast of San Francisco pinpointed the epicenter of Tuesday's killer quake in the northeast corner of the Nisene Marks State Park near the top of Aptos Creek, said Joseph Cotton with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.        That's about 57 miles from San Francisco atop the San Andreas Fault, and just 14 miles northeast of hard-hit Santa Cruz, where 10,000 people are reported displaced from their homes.         Electricity was restored to almost all of the Bay Area, and an armada of boats assembled to ferry commuters across the San Francisco Bay, as business got back to normal.  The main lifeline between San Francisco and Oakland, the Bay Bridge, was closed with a 50-foot-long section collapsed, and estimates for its reopening have grown more pessimistic, with some officials saying it could take as long as two months.        Engineers hoped to use a floating crane to lift the fallen 200-ton, five-lane highway span onto a barge this weekend and begin repairs, the Transportation Department said.        In all, Mayor Lionel Wilson estimated damages in Oakland at $1.3 billion - not including the freeway collapse.        In San Francisco, Mayor Art Agnos said the city's $5.9 million reserve fund has been depleted.        ``On paper,'' he said, ``the city is broke.''        The president, asked about damage estimates ranging from $2.5 billion to $10 billion for the quake region, said it would be premature to make a specific commitment of money.        `` . . . We will do what is necessary to fulfill the federal responsibility just as I expect the state will and the local government (will),'' Bush said. `` . . . In terms of cost, we have to get a figure on it."        Legislation to waive the $100 million cap on emergency federal highway funds was introduced in the U.S. Senate yesterday so California could receive extra money for repairing the Bay Bridge and other federal highways.        Gov. George Deukmejian said he would not hesitate to propose temporarily raising state sales taxes if more money is needed to rebuild.        Deukmejian said there is precedent for such a temporary tax hike, adding that gasoline taxes sometimes have been increased to pay for road repairs from natural disasters.        ``It's very major destruction. The high costs involved are going to take a major effort to restore,'' he said.         Millions of dollars and offers of everything from clothing to chiropractors flowed into Northern California yesterday as thousands of refugees from quake-buckled homes waited anxiously in makeshift shelters.        Relief officials worried that the aid, though widespread, wasn't enough to fill the needs of what by some estimates could be the most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history.        ``What we need is cash,'' said Laurie Levy, spokesperson for the Red Cross chapter in San Francisco, which was routing donations of food, clothing, blankets and other goods to the Salvation Army and other aid groups.    --  Compiled from Associated Press, United Press International, Knight-Ridder News Service and Reuters.Caption:  PHOTOUNABLE TO REACH EACH OTHER SINCE TUESDAY'S EARTHQUAKE.HARLEY SOLTES / SEATTLE TIMES: PRESIDENT BUSH LISTENS TO A DESCRIPTION OF THE EXTRICATION PROCESS FOR CARS AND EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS DURING A TOUR OF THE INTERSTATE 880 STRUCTURE THAT COLLAPSED.CAROLYN CLIFTON, HOPING THAT TELEVISION CREWS COVERING BUSH'S TOUR QUAKE DAMAGE IN OAKLAND WOULD PHOTOGRAPH HER, HOLDS A SIGN - A MESSAGE TO HER SON IN WASHINGTON, D.C., THAT SHE IS ALIVE.
