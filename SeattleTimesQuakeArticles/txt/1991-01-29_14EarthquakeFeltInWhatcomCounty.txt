DEMING, Whatcom County - A small earthquake rattled the Deming area early today.        There were no reports of damage or injuries, although some area residents called a radio station in Bellingham, about 15 miles to the southwest, to report they had felt the quake.        University of Washington research scientist Rick Benson said the quake measured just 1.4 on the Richter scale - so slight it is surprising humans could feel it.        Shallow earthquakes have been rattling the Deming area since April 1989.
