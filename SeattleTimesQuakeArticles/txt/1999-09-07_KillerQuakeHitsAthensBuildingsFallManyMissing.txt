ATHENS - The strongest earthquake to hit Athens in nearly a century toppled buildings this afternoon, sending hundreds of thousands of terrified people into debris-littered streets. At least 27 people died and nearly 100 were reported missing.    Dozens of people were injured by falling glass, concrete and marble slabs shaken loose by the 10-second quake.         According to the Athens Seismological Institute, the 2:56 p.m. quake had a preliminary magnitude of 5.9 and was centered about 12 miles north of Athens. The epicenter was between Menidi and Mount Parnes, which is a national park and sparsely inhabited.    Power and telephone service were out in many places in this city of more than 5 million.     Some people sought safety  in the National Garden in central Athens, near the site of a concert planned for later in the day to aid victims of last month's monstrous quake in neighboring Turkey that claimed more than 15,000 lives. That quake registered a magnitude of 7.4.    "Everyone panicked, especially because of the recent Turkish quake," said Dimitris Lalas, head of the Athens Seismological Institute. George Skordilis, a seismologist with the  institute, said there was no clear connection with the Turkish quake, but "we can say there is increased earthquake activity in the eastern Mediterranean."     Greece has a history of powerful and deadly quakes.    In 1995, a 6.1 magnitude quake killed 26 people in Aegio, about 120 miles southwest of Athens. The deadliest quake in Greece in recent decades was a 6.5 temblor in 1978 in the northern port of Thessaloniki, which killed 45 people.    Since a strong 1981 temblor felt in Athens, most buildings in the capital have been built and reinforced to withstand quakes. The area most damaged by today's quake was a lower-income area where contractors tend to use less expensive building materials, officials said.    More than 100 buildings crumbled, including multistory apartment houses and older stone dwellings, state media said. The most serious damage was in the Menidi district and other immigrant and working-class areas north of central Athens.    There was no apparent damage to ancient sites, including the Acropolis and the towering columns of the Temple of Zeus.Caption:  MAPTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS: GREEK EARTHQUAKE (MAP NOT AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY)
