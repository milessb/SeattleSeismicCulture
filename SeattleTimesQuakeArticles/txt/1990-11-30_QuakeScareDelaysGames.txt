SCOOBA, Miss. - A Mississippi junior college is delaying by one week its men's and women's basketball games Monday because of predictions of a possible weekend earthquake.        ``It's probably the first time in the history of Mississippi that we've had a game postponed because of a potential earthquake,'' said Dale Peay, East Mississippi women's coach.        School officials said the games were pushed back to Dec. 10 at the request of Coahoma Community College.        New Mexico climatologist Iben Browning has said there is a high probability of an earthquake somewhere on the New Madrid fault this weekend.
