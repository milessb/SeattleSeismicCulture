The vast majority of Washington homeowners are uninsured for the major earthquake that scientists say rumbles in Puget Sound's future. But homeowners here and throughout the rest of the country would be covered under a bill now before Congress         Rep. Al Swift, D-Bellingham, is proposing a national insurance pool that would require every homeowner to pay an earthquake premium on top of existing coverage, ranging perhaps from $2 a year for parts of the country with low earthquake risk to $50 a year for high-risk areas.         In addition to covering all homeowners, the pool would be intended to help avert financial disaster for insurance companies and to avoid emergency demands for federal tax money in the aftermath of a quake.         Only 7 percent of state homeowners have earthquake insurance, up from 4 percent before last fall's quake in San Francisco, according to Scott Carpenter, regional vice president of the Insurance Information Institute in Seattle.         Swift's legislative director says the insurance industry asked Swift to sponsor the bill because of fears about the risk of insuring against earthquakes.         ``There's just no question about it - it would bankrupt every insurance company in the business if it hit a wide-enough area,'' said Ed Ives, deputy state insurance commissioner.         If a national pool were established, insurance companies would have to pay the first $8 billion in claims, and then the pool would kick in.         ``We see this as being a wash for the insurance companies,'' said Scott Cooper, legislative director to Swift in Washington. ``They will not make money on it, or at least they shouldn't make money on it.''         A national pool also would help alleviate the impact of an earthquake on bridges, highways, gas pipelines, computer and telecommunications networks that would ripple through the national economy, Swift told a House subcommittee last week. Homeowners and insurance companies themselves would pay for earthquake relief, not just taxpayers ponying up for yet another disaster.         Some may ask why people in middle America should subsidize insurance for people who choose to live in quake-prone areas.         ``It goes right to the heart of the philosophy of insurance, which is risk-spreading,'' said Cooper.         ``A good portion of the country has had at least some earthquake activity in the past, so while (an earthquake outside a high-risk area) is less likely, it is still possible,'' said Steven Malone, a geophysics research professor at the University of Washington.         He adds that less-prone areas could suffer more damage, because structures  may not be fortified as well for a quake.         A federal insurance program exists for floods which, like earthquakes, affect some areas more than others, Carpenter says.         Another bill similar to Swift's has been introduced by Rep. George Brown Jr., D-Calif. Hearings may be held on Swift's bill in September or early October.         Bringing more people into the pool would decrease the cost of earthquake insurance, Swift estimates, by as much as 75 percent.         The cost now varies from 25 cents to $1.25 per $1,000 value of a home, with masonry structures more expensive than wood frames because they are much less resilient, according to Carpenter.         The deductible normally is 5 to 10 percent, Carpenter says, so the owner of a fully insured $100,000 home would have to pay for the first $5,000 to $10,000 of damage.         ``Affordable insurance is good public policy,'' Cooper said.         ``There is no question that a large, damaging earthquake will occur in the Puget Sound area,'' said Malone. ``There is no question about that at all. The question is when.''         Another question is how big. Most geophysicists agree that a quake registering 7 on the Richter scale - like the one in San Francisco - will hit within the next few decades.          Up until a few years ago, an even more powerful ``megathrust'' earthquake - like the one that hit Alaska in 1964 - was not considered likely in the Pacific Northwest,  but now it is considered possible. Such a quake may have occurred here about 300 years ago, but scientists disagree over when and if another one might shake loose.
