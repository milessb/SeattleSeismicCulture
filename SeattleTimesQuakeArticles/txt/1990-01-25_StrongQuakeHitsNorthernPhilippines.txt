MANILA, Philippines - A strong earthquake rocked the northern Philippines today but there were no reports of casualties or damage, the government's Geophysical Division said.         Seismologist Bart Bautista said the tremor, measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale and powerful enough to cause heavy damage in a populated area, was centered in the sea 300 miles north of Manila.
