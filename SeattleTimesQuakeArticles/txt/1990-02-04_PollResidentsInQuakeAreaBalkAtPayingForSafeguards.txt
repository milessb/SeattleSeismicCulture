SAN JOSE, Calif. - From Oakland to Santa Cruz, residents want to spend whatever it takes to make sure bridges, tunnels, highways and buildings withstand a major earthquake. But about half said they do not want the money coming out of their own pocket, a San Jose Mercury News poll shows    Months after the 7.1-magnitude quake, emergency preparedness and disaster relief are not atop the public agenda - even though 65 percent of those surveyed said they suffered emotional turmoil after the Oct. 17 quake, and one-fifth said they considered moving out of earthquake country.    ``It's not uncommon for people to have a sense of frugality when it comes to their own personal finances, so I can't blame them,'' said Assemblyman Dominic Cortese, D-San Jose, who is a legislative delegate to the state's Seismic Safety Commission. ``But I think it's unfortunate that earthquakes all of a sudden are slipping from the No. 1 ranking of priorities. Our whole quality of life is at stake here.''    About 85 percent favor measures to ensure that bridges and buildings are safe during a future quake ``no matter what it costs.'' But by 52 percent to 37.5 percent, residents oppose any plan to ease spending limits to pay for that.    There is only lukewarm support for most tax raises earmarked for earthquake safety, but 68 percent said they would be willing to pay a 10-cent gasoline levy for one year if they could be assured it would pay for bridge and highway work.
