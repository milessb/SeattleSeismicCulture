BOLINAS, Calif. - A moderate earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.0 jolted residents of the San Francisco Bay Area but caused no major damage or injuries, even at its epicenter in this seaside town.    The quake struck at 6:06 p.m. PDT yesterday  near Bolinas, about 30 miles north of San Francisco.    No major injuries were reported, although the quake rocked cars, made streetlights swing in San Francisco and rattled homes as far north as Santa Rosa. At the San Jose airport, workers felt the control tower shake.    In Bolinas, bottles crashed to barroom and grocery-store floors, and a bakery's tin chimney toppled.     "The floor rolled and then snapped back . . .  like the snap of a towel," said Mike, a patron at Smiley's bar who would not give his last name.    Skip Schwartz, executive director of the Audubon ranch, a 1,000-acre wildlife sanctuary, said the birds were circling during the quake, which lasted about 10 seconds.    "The birds got out of the trees, and they were all up in the air. The noise and vibrations must have been profound for them, at the top of these hundred-foot tall redwoods," he said.    Four noticeable aftershocks were recorded within the next 2 1/2 hours within a mile of Bolinas, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
