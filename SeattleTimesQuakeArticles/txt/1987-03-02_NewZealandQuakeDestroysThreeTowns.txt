AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The strongest earthquake to hit New Zealand in 65 years destroyed three towns on the northeastern coast today, toppling buildings, buckling roads and leaving thousands homeless        Civil-defense authorities reported an elderly man died of a heart attack during the quake, two people were missing and dozens were reported injured.        Aftershocks continued to rumble through the Bay of Plenty region tonight, about 260 miles northeast of the capital of Wellington.        Ewan Smith, head of the New Zealand Seismological Institute, reported the main earthquake struck at 2:15 p.m. today, New Zealand time (7:15 p.m. PST yesterday) and measured 6.5 on the open-ended Richter scale. The epicenter was 35 miles offshore.        Late today, he said more than 100 aftershocks had been recorded since, with the largest measuring 4.5 on the Richter scale.        Worst hit were the towns of Whakatane, Kawerau and Edgecumbe, where police said 95 percent of the homes were rendered uninhabitable _ many knocked off their foundations or split down the middle.        The ground opened up in cracks, one measuring 1.2 miles in length and 3 yards deep.        Evacuees from Edgecumbe said the ground ``rolled like the sea'' and that several houses just missed falling into a huge crack that opened up for more than a mile across nearby farmland. They said the crack swallowed driveways, swimming pools, sheds and power poles.        Radio Pacific said there were reports of damage from Tauranga and Rotorua as well.        Civil Defense Director Edward Latter said those injured included two forestry workers hit by a falling tree, two employees trapped in a paper mill whose walls collapsed and a motorist whose car was buried in a landslide.        Telephone service and electricity were cut off throughout the region, Latter said.        Residents living below the Matahina dam were evacuated after it cracked. Water was released to ease the pressure.        It was the strongest quake to hit the area since a tremor registering 6.5 on July 26, 1961, said Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist at the U.S. National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
