LOS ANGELES - The Northern California earthquake destroyed millions of dollars worth of fruits and vegetables, and displaced agriculture workers are too busy finding housing to return to the fields or help clean up, officials said        Most of the food ruined in last week's earthquake was crushed in warehouse collapses or spoiled in frozen-food processing plants brought to a halt.        ``The loss will be in the millions,'' said Steve Arnoldy, of San Benito Foods, which owns six  tomato warehouses in Hollister. ``Some of our buildings we can't even get into.''        Cans and drums filled with 400,000 tons of the San Francisco Bay Area summer tomato harvest came tumbling down in many of the 14 corrugated-steel-wall warehouses of Hollister.        An ammonia leak at the Green Giant frozen-food plant in Watsonville could result in $20 million worth of losses in frozen Brussels sprouts, broccoli and other vegetables.         Seattle-based Associated Grocers, which gets almost all of its celery and cauliflower this time of year from the Salinas Valley just south of Santa Cruz,  says it hasn't had any problems with produce availability up to now.         ``The only problem we had after the quake was communication because phone lines were down,'' said Vern Hortsch of Associated Grocers. Associated provides produce and other items for its 300 members in Washington.         ``In the last few days, we've seen some price increases,'' he said. ``But that has to do more with the heavy rains down there than with the quake.''        Cool weather kept unprocessed food from spoiling, but a lack of returning workers has delayed cleanup of about $1 million worth of goods that fell from warehouse pallets during the quake.
