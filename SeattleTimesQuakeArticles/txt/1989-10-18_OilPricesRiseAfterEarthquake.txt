TOKYO - Concern that yesterday's massive earthquake may have ruptured oil and gas pipelines and damaged refineries in San Francisco triggered a 30-cent-per-barrel jump in the price of U.S. crude oil today, oil traders said        ``If gas pipelines are ruptured, gas supplies could be totally cut off and crude oil would have to make it up,'' said one U.S. oil company official based in Tokyo.        On the Far East spot market, the benchmark U.S. crude, West Texas Intermediate, traded at $20.66 for December delivery, 29 cents above the last traded level in the United States yesterday.        ``It's skyrocketing,'' said one Japanese oil trader.        The surge in U.S. oil prices also pulled up the price of Britain's internationally traded Brent Blend crude. A December loading cargo traded at $19.02 in the Asian market today, up from around $18.90 at the U.S. close yesterday.        The quake also affected the London market for gasoil, from which diesel fuel and heating fuel are distilled.        Futures on the London International Petroleum exchange rose to their highest levels in nearly four years because of fears that West Coast damage would increase already high demand.        ``It is not quantified yet but anyone who has got any interest in that area will be concerned that they may not be able to fulfill deals and they have gone into the market to cover themselves,'' said a London dealer.        Prices for refined products are also likely to rise.        ``Everyone is waiting for more news on the earthquake in San Francisco, but fears of serious damage to oil pipelines and a shortage of supply of jet kerosene, gasoil, will push prices up sharply,'' said an oil refiner in Singapore.        There are six oil refineries in the San Francisco area with a combined total refining capacity of nearly one million barrels per day of crude oil, according to the International Petroleum Encyclopedia.        Damage to the refineries and the pipelines feeding them could not immediately be verified.        But a Chevron spokeswoman in New York said the company's 215,000-barrel-per-day Richmond refinery, across the bay from San Francisco, was operating as usual.        She said the quake forced the refinery to switch to emergency power but regular power had since been restored.        Meanwhile, lack of accurate information about the scale of the disaster made for nervous trading on markets already in turmoil following last week's Friday the 13th selloff on Wall Street.        In midday trading today, the Dow Jones industrial average had gained 14.96 points to 2,653.69. That followed yesterday's loss of 18.65 points to 2,638.73.        Michael Benson, U.S. trader at Shearson Lehman Hutton in London, said stock markets were being guided by fear of the unknown concerning the earthquake. How widespread was the damage? Would there be more tremors?        ``People will be worried whether they're exposed to insurance stocks or not. Sentiment will drag them down,'' he said.        There was particular uncertainty about how the disaster might affect insurance companies.        Some London stocks were marked down because of fears of claims resulting from earthquake damage but companies which act mainly as insurance agents rose slightly.
