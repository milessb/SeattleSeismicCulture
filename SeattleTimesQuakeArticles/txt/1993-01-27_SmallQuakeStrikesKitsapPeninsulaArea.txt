SEATTLE      A small earthquake rumbled beneath the Kitsap Peninsula yesterday about halfway between Tacoma and Bremerton.     The quake, at 9:05 a.m., measured 3 on the Richter scale and was about 15 miles deep, the University of Washington seismology lab reported. A similar quake occurred in the same area a year ago, the lab said.
