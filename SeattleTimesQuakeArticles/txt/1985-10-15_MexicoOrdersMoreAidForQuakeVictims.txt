MEXICO CITY (AP) _ President Miguel de la Madrid yesterday ordered a social-welfare committee to help people left homeless by last month's earthquakes.        The committee is charged with easing the quake victims back into a normal life and advising the president's National Reconstruction Commission about education, health and employment.        The president has said the problems of the homeless will be the first priority of the reconstruction effort, which is expected to take years. Government figures show there are about 30,000 people living in 163 shelters scattered throughout the city.        In a related development, Francisco Norena Casado, city public-works director, said most of the 400,000 tons of debris caused by the earthquakes could be cleaned up by the end of the month.        The first quake, on Sept. 19, registered 8.1 on the Richter scale, and the second the following evening measured 7.5. The official death toll stands at 4,600, though private estimates put the number of dead at about 8,000.        Norena Casado said workers were removing up to 15,000 cubic yards of debris daily, but that the rate should increase in coming days as fewer bodies are found.        The earthquakes created pockets of destruction throughout the city with office buildings, apartments and homes reduced to piles of rubble, often trapping people inside.        Last Friday, de la Madrid expropriated 618 acres of land in the city's most heavily damaged areas. He created a special agency yesterday to oversee reconstruction on that land.        The government says it will spend $150 million on new housing for the areas and will consult the residents about what is built.
