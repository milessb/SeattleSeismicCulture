SAN JOSE, Calif. - The Loma Prieta earthquake of Northern California apparently did more than knock down buildings and tear up roads: It also did weird things to the water supply.        Officials have noticed that streams throughout the area swelled after the Oct. 17 quake and are just now returning to normal.        The extra flows apparently came from water in the ground at higher elevations in the Santa Cruz Mountains - a situation that could leave some mountain residents with dry wells for decades, said Robert Curry, a professor of environmental geology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.        Stuart Rojstaczer, a research hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), is a bit more cautious: ``Where the water table will wind up over the long haul (and) the question of when the wells will be usable again is really up in the air.''        Within hours of the quake, the flow in the San Lorenzo River at Santa Cruz's Tate Street intake increased 20 percent, Curry said. Upstream, in the San Lorenzo Valley, the flow increased by at least 150 percent.         On the Santa Clara County side of the mountains, some flows in Stevens Creek increased by four times, Rojstaczer said.         Dennis Dresti, raw-water operations superintendent for the Santa Clara Valley Water District, said that when he checked district streams the day after the quake, ``it was incredible'' to see how fast some of them were running even though no rain had fallen.        Meanwhile, water in some mountain wells increased. But many others dried up.        Curry said water supplies have changed after other earthquakes, too, but no one has ever really studied the phenomenon. This time, Rojstaczer and Curry are doing so under USGS sponsorship.        Curry said he is trying to investigate one theory: that some underground water tables ``were torn up and the water came out the bottom,'' as Watsonville, Calif., well driller Dave Maggiora put it.        While the fractured-rock theory seems obvious at first, Curry said, it has some problems. One is the fact that the ground water also has dropped in areas where the rock did not break apart.        And stream flows increased all at once, indicating that excess water did not just come from higher elevations.        Curry said his studies suggest another possibility: that tiny plugs were blown out of the rocks by the quake, increasing the permeability of the rocks so more water could flow from the ground into the streams. He has found tiny particles suspended in stream water that might endorse this theory.        The difference is important, he said. If the fractured-rock theory is correct, it could be decades before new supplies of ground water can collect in the affected mountain areas.        But if the plug theory is true, the plugs probably would re-form and allow a new water supply to build up quickly, Curry said.
