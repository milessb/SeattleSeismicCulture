Rescuers and spectators cheered as Luisa Mallorca and Arnel Calabia were lifted out of the rubble of the Hyatt Hotel.        Doctors said Calabia, a hotel security guard, and Mallorca, a cleaning woman, were in surprisingly good condition. Calabia said he, Mallorca and a man dived under tables when the quake struck, ``and then the ceiling fell in.        ``We recovered consciousness later and we called out to each other,'' Calabia said.
