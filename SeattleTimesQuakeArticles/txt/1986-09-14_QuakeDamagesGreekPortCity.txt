ATHENS, Greece _ A powerful earthquake toppled buildings and damaged scores of homes yesterday in the southwestern port city of Kalamata, killing at least six people and injuring more than 200.     The government declared a state of emergency and began airlifting medical supplies and tents to the city of about 80,000 in the Peloponnesus region 110 miles southwest of Athens.     The earthquake caused the collapse of many older homes and a five-story apartment building in the Nissaki neighborhood in Kalamata.     Seriously injured people were being flown to Athens because Kalamata's hospital was damaged and considered unsafe.     The quake damaged hundreds of other buildings, including the city hall, police headquarters and the residence of the governor of Kalamata province.     Six people were found dead in the debris, and police feared more were dead.     The earthquake knocked out electricity and telephone service in much of the city.     Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Yannis Haralambopoulos flew to Kalamata to direct relief efforts.     Landslides cut off the road to the historic city of Sparta, 40 miles to the east.     The last major earthquake in the region struck Feb. 24, 1981, the U.S. Geological Survey said. That quake, centered in the Athens area, killed 16 people and injured more than 400.
