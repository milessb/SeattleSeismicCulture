STUTTGART, West Germany _ A weak earthquake shook the Schwabian hills of southern West Germany early yesterday, causing slight damage to two buildings but no injuries, authorities said.        Earthquakes are rare in West Germany, and initial checks found no one who recalled the last significant tremor.        The Geophysics Institute of the Stuttgart University said yesterday's tremor measured between 3.5 and 4 on the open-ended Richter scale.
