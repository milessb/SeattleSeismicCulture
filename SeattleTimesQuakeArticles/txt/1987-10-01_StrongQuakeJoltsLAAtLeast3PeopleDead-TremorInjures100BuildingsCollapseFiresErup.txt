A strong earthquake struck Southern California this morning, collapsing buildings, sending cars a foot off the ground, closing freeways and setting off fires from ruptured gas lines. At least three people were killed and 100 people were injured        The quake was felt as far south as San Diego, north to Santa Barbara and as far east as Las Vegas.        Authorities said there were extensive reports of damage within a 20-mile radius of the epicenter.        Initial reports of the quake's magnitude varied from 5.5 to 6.1 on the Richter scale.          Lupe Esposito, 21, of San Gabriel, a student at California State University at Los Angeles, was killed when a wall in a parking structure at the school collapsed, Cable News Network reported. The quake also set off a fire at a high-rise building on the campus.          Pasadena Fire Battalion Chief Duncan Baird said a man was buried under seven feet of earth 35 feet into a tunnel under construction and was presumed dead. Rescuers had been searching for him at the site in Eaton Canyon in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Pasadena.         A 60-year-old man died of a heart attack, authorities said.         Fire officials had said earlier that another man was electrocuted in a church fire, but they said later that report was erroneous.         The first jolt was recorded at 7:42 a.m. PDT, when the city's freeways were jammed with commuters.         Waverly Person, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center in Denver, said it measured 6.1 on the Richter scale, but the University of California in Berkeley estimated it at 5.5.        The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park and California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said the quake was centered 15 miles south of Pasadena in the Montebello-South Gate-Downey area at the north end of the Whittier-Elsinore Fault.           Caltech reported at least 15 aftershocks of more than 3 on the Richter scale, including two that measured 4.4.        Kate Hutton, a geophysicist at Caltech, said that after a quake of this size there is a one in 20 chance of an even larger quake within five days.        (The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.)          Walls crumbled, windows shattered and ceilings collapsed in scattered locations throughout the metropolitan area. Telephone, radio and television systems were momentarily knocked out of service by the quake, and there were numerous reports of gas and water leaks.         Power outages trapped scores of workers in stalled elevators and thousands of early morning workers were ordered to evacuate downtown office buildings.         It was the strongest quake in the Los Angeles area since 1971, when the Sylmar quake in the San Fernando Valley, northwest of Los Angeles, registered 6.4 on the Richter scale. That quake killed 64 people and caused $1 billion in damage.           Linnea Hunt-Stewart, a magazine editor who lives in Pasadena, said this morning's quake felt as bad as the one in 1971, but it was not rolling like that one.         ``This was a big boom, then massive shaking that felt like it lasted about 15 seconds,'' she said.           ``The dogs are going crazy, cabinet doors flung open, books are all over the floor, crockery is smashed and I can't call out.''         Joanie Haskell, also of Pasadena, said: ``It was a very violent shake. I've probably felt four earthquakes in my life, and this felt much bigger than any of them. You didn't hear the earth rumble like you often do, it was just more of a shudder.''         In West Los Angeles, Cheryl Wilkinson, a paralegal, said, ``It was heavier than the quake in '71, more violent and jarring.'' Books fell off shelves at her house today, too.         Broken glass from thousands of windows littered some streets and there were reports of landslides. Hundreds of police patrolled the streets.          Los Angeles Fire Chief Don Manning said the department had responded to 46 fires caused by natural-gas leaks, 26 structural fires, 36 heart attacks and 21 elevators with people stuck in them, and 14 traffic accidents.        Authorities said buildings collapsed in Whittier, Pasadena and Hollywood.        Cable News Network reported that the Del Mar Convalescent Home in Rosemead partially collapsed, but all 53 residents were safely evacuated.         That was a moving contrast to the scene in 1971 when a hospital collapsed, killing scores of people.         Justin Demello, a Los Angeles County fire department spokesman, reported that a roof caved in at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Bellflower, 15 miles southeast of downtown. There were no reports of injuries there.         Landslides rumbled down the neighboring San Gabriel Mountains and in the Los Angeles canyons, where many people live.         People who were at home ran into the streets as the first tremor smashed windows, sent books and plates tumbling off shelves and left swaying.         Children who had gone to school early hid under their desks. Many cried with fright, teachers said.         Power to downtown Los Angeles eas knocked out for nearly an hour.        Drivers said the quake sent cars jumping a foot in the air. Branches of trees cracked and palm trees crashed to the ground.         An air-traffic reporter for KNX radio, Judy Abe, said, ``All the traffic stopped in all the (freeway) lanes. Quite unusual.''        Burbank Airport Control Tower 10 miles northwest of downtown was closed because the quake shattered all the windows.         Los Angeles International Airport was closed briefly while the runways were checked for cracks.         Amtrak and freight train service was halted temporarily while workmen checked tracks, but operations resumed within a couple of hours.         At the City Hall emergency center in downtown Los Angeles, Lt. Larry Townsend said, ``All downtown buildings have been evacuated, including Parker Center, which is the police department. At the time of the earthquake, about 3,000 were evacuated from city-run buildings.''        ``We have no bodily injuries, but extensive structural damage,'' Townsend said. ``There are lots of cracks in buildings. There is glass everywhere.''           Police Officer William Frio said there had been five arrests for looting in various parts of the city where windows were shattered. Police spokesman Lt. Dan Cooke said a special anti-looting squad was working downtown.          Federal, county and city authorities ordered the immediate evacuation of government buildings.          The quake set off a fire at a small shopping mall two miles southwest of downtown, with smoke and flames coming out of at least seven stores.           Much of Los Angeles was in confusion with people packing the streets. But even the streets scared some.        ``I'm scared to walk,'' said Mei Ling. ``Up and down the road I saw the buildings swaying and one man came running shaking like a leaf and all the stop lights were shaking up and down like a leaf.''        ``There are so many fires throughout the city we couldn't count them,'' Fire Department Capt. Donald Cross said at the scene of a ruptured water main at a downtown shopping complex.        Les Eng, an attorney, was driving on La Brea Boulevard in Baldwin Hills when the quake struck. ``My car was buffeted, as if by winds,'' he said. Shortly after he arrived at his office in Los Angeles, the building was evacuated.         ``There were so many people in the streets it looked like the pope was in town,'' he said. He said one man was arrested after trying to steal clothing from a mannequin behind by a broken window at a downtown department store.          Floyd Gregory, parking-lot attendant at the City Criminal Courts, said: ``The cars were knocked about from side to side. I was expecting the earth to open up at any moment.        ``I looked at the City Hall across the street and those antennas on top were really wobbling. I was here for the 1971 earthquake, but it didn't feel as bad as this one.''         Concrete slabs fell from the side of a prison being built in the city center, but no one was apparently hurt.         Damage from the quake was still being assessed.         Rock slides left boulders on many of the area's major commuter highways, forcing the California Highway Patrol to close parts of the Pasadena Freeway and the San Bernardino Freeway.          Interstate 10, the Santa Monica Freeway, was closed at Fourth Avenue in Los Angeles because of quake damage.        Authorities said the Santa Ana Freeway was closed about 15 miles southeast of the city near Pico Rivera because of cracks in five central support pillars on I-605, which crosses over the Santa Ana.          Power was knocked out in parts of the city and fire companies were placed on alert throughout the city.         Telephone lines were jammed. Repeated attempts to place telephone calls from Seattle to the Los Angeles area were frustrated for hours.
