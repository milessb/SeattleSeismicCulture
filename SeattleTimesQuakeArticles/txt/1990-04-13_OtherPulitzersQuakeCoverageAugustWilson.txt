NEW YORK - In other Pulitzer Prize awards, the San Jose Mercury News and The Tribune of Oakland won Pulitzer Prizes yesterday for their coverage of last October's northern California earthquake, and playwright August Wilson captured his second Pulitzer Prize for drama in four years when he was honored with the 1990 award for ``The Piano Lesson.'        The prizes, recognizing outstanding work in journalism and the arts, are presented annually by Columbia University.         The Mercury News, which used emergency generators to put out its post-quake edition, won the prize for general news reporting. The Tribune's photo staff won for spot news photography.        The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Washington (N.C.) Daily News won the Pulitzer's gold medals for public service journalism, the Inquirer for reporting on how the blood industry operates with little regulation, and the Daily News for revealing that the city water supply was contaminated with carcinogens.        This is the first time in 23 years the Pulitzer board awarded two gold medals. It was the Inquirer's 17th Pulitzer Prize, all won in the past 15 years, and the sixth straight year the newspaper has won an award.        It was the first award for the Washington Daily News, circulation 10,000.        ``I will say we haven't had this much excitement in this town since the Union cavalry and the Confederate cavalry chased each other up Main Street in 1862, and there's been nothing like that since,'' said Bill Coughlin, the newspaper's executive editor.         August Wilson's ``The Piano Lesson,'' opens Monday on Broadway. Wilson won in 1987 for ``Fences.''        Oscar Hijuelos' book, ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,'' won the 1990 Pulitzer for fiction. Hijuelos' novel detailed the lives of two brothers from Havana who become minor celebrities as musicians in New York nightclubs.        It was only the second novel written by Hijuelos. Pulitzer Administrator Robert Christopher said he believed Hijuelos was the first Hispanic winner of the Pulitzer for fiction.        Stanley Karnow's book, ``In Our Image: America's Empire in the Philippines,'' won for history. Karnow is a longtime foreign correspondent for several news organizations. He also wrote ``Vietnam: A History,'' which later won six Emmy Awards in its television incarnation.
