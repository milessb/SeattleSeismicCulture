ANCHORAGE        An earthquake strong enough to ``shake dishes'' jolted residents of Anchorage and Palmer overnight, but no damage was reported.        The epicenter of the quake, which occurred at 11:55 p.m. and measured 5.0 on the Richter scale, was in unpopulated areas, said Bob Hammond of the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer.        A quake of 5.0 magnitude can shake dishes and potentially crack drywalls.
