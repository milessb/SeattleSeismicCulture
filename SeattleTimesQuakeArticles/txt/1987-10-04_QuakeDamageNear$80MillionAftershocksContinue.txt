LOS ANGELES _ Damage estimates in the 6.1-magnitude earthquake that jarred Southern California last week approached $80 million yesterday as state inspectors picked their way through rubble and sightseers in the hardest-hit areas        Officials in surrounding cities have already reported damage totaling $77 million. Three people were killed by the quake directly, and another three died from quake-induced heart attacks.        The curious yesterday descended on downtown Whittier, near the quake's epicenter _ which had been roped off because of collapsed buildings and shattered windows _ clogging the area and prompting police to issue a warning.        The rubble-strewn streets of the city, declared a disaster area by Gov. George Deukmejian, have been cleaned up and most of the debris has been cleared away.       But minor aftershocks have continued as the earth gently adjusts to stresses. The same day as the quake, there were 16 aftershocks, and there were more than 100 by yesterday afternoon. But most were very small _ under 4 on the Richter scale.        Besides the aftershocks, residents had to deal with sweltering heat as the mercury hit 108 degrees downtown. It was the hottest Oct. 3 on record for the Los Angeles area.        While damage outside the hardest-hit areas was limited, Deukmejian's official state of emergency extended to all 82 cities in Los Angeles County and unincorporated areas. Whittier and Monterey Park were declared emergency areas, which will speed the processing of federal disaster assistance and pave the way for property-tax relief for victims.        Whatever the havoc wrought by Thursday's temblor, disaster coordinators agree that California has come a long way since the 1971 quake, centered in Sylmar in the northeastern San Fernando Valley, when extensive damage and loss of lives were blamed on a relative lack of preparedness.        Damage to 17 area hospitals was a critical blow during the Sylmar quake. At least 40 people died when one hospital collapsed.        No hospitals turned into death traps this time, largely because of legislation passed since the 1971 temblor raising seismic standards for hospital construction and requiring existing hospitals to institute new safeguards, such as anchoring heavy equipment.        The Sylmar quake also brought about an ordinance mandating the reinforcement of older masonry buildings. Erected before a major 1933 earthquake changed standards for building materials, such structures must now be shored up to withstand seismic force.        ``These were the kind you saw in Whittier crumbling onto cars,'' said Arthur Johnson of the city Department of Building and Safety. ``Whittier doesn't have the same code we adopted.''        But as Southern California shakes off its most severe earthquake in 16 years, geologists warn that Thursday's temblor was little more than a small-scale rehearsal for the ``Big One.''        That's how seismologists and citizens alike here refer to the massive earthquake likely to occur sometime in the next 30 years along the San Andreas Fault, granddaddy of all California fault lines.        Chances are the Big One would measure at least 7.5 and maybe an 8 on the Richter scale _ 1,000 times as strong as Thursday's quake _ and would kill up to 14,000 people, seriously injure another 50,000 and cause $17 billion in property damage. One thing is for sure, seismologists say: The quake Thursday did not relieve enough pressure along the San Andreas to affect the Big One.        For most Californians, the two biggest questions about the Big One are where and when it will strike.        But not even the world's leading earthquake research laboratory, the seismological lab on the campus of the California Institute of Technology, can offer more than guesswork.        Their best guesses today are that the next maximum earthquake on the San Andreas will come somewhere along the fault's southern reaches, with the odds of it happening in any given year slightly less than 5 percent.        The focus of the seismologists' attention today is a 120-mile stretch running from the top of the San Gabriel Mountains about 60 miles northwest of Palm Springs to the Salton Sea, about 60 miles southeast of that desert resort city.        That portion of the fault, known as the ``Indio sector,'' hasn't had a massive earthquake since about 1680, when Spanish conquistadors had only begun settling the American Southwest. Carbon dating of wood chunks from that sector has shown it normally sees a giant earthquake about once in 280 years, so one is overdue.        There has been about three feet of gradual slippage along the fault over the past three centuries. The northern and central portions of the San Andreas both have seen massive earthquakes much more recently than the Indio stretch.
