PORT LIONS, Alaska (AP) _ Rhea Knagin still remembers what she wore 22 years ago, on the day she and other Afognak residents huddled high on a snowy hillside and watched a giant wave wash away their village         That Good Friday, she had put on a fancy blue dress to see the movie ``King of Kings'' at the community hall. ``That was the first building to go floating out of Afognak, and the movie went out with it,'' said Knagin, 50. ``Never did see that movie.''         Four houses and the village store also floated out of Afognak, a remote village on a remote island in the Gulf of Alaska. Many other houses were destroyed. The wave moved Knagin's house several feet, dropping it on a tree stump and cracking it like an egg.         The Alaska earthquake of March 27, 1964, was North America's greatest recorded quake, measuring 8.5 on the Richter scale. It killed at least 114 people, most of whom drowned in tsunamis, the huge waves generated by the shifting ocean floor.ars later, many still are trying to get used to the idea.         Villagers scouted the forested coastline of Afognak Island and neighboring Kodiak Island for a new home. They found a site by a protected cove, 12 miles away on Kodiak Island. There was good water and a place for a small boat harbor. And, like Afognak, it was remote, with no roads connecting it to the outside world. Access was by boat or airplane only _ the way Afognak people liked it.         With help from charitable groups around the country, people quickly built a new village of 45 simple frame houses. They moved in eight months after the big wave.         In honor of the Lions Club, one of the first groups to lend a hand, the villagers named their new home Port Lions.         Today, the population of Port Lions is 290 and slowly growing. Nestled on a wooded hill between the cove and high mountains are 99 houses, two general stores, a medical clinic, cafe, community hall and a corrugated metal fire station with one fire truck.         It's still a youngster, as towns go. Bleached stumps of Sitka spruce mark empty lots where the forest was cleared. The small cemetery at the edge of town has plenty of vacancies.         Frequent visitors say Port Lions is more reserved and quiet than other villages in the area _ perhaps because its residents have learned that even the solid earth beneath them is not always a firm foundation.         On a recent winter day, the most noise in the village came from a gang of cackling crows riding the northerly breeze over rooftops. Beach gravel hushed the lapping waves, while a few yards up the hill, the cafe window framed a pair of eyes that followed two strangers dodging puddles along the dirt road.         But one does not stay a stranger long in Port Lions before the conversation and bottomless pots of coffee start flowing.         Bears are a favorite subject. Kodiak Island's huge brown bears wander through town at will. A party of nine dined at the dump one recent night, provoking considerable consternation among human inhabitants.         Another favorite topic, in a place soaked by nearly 60 inches of rain a year, is the weather. And the weather is linked to the all-consuming subject of Port Lions _ fishing.         As they did in Afognak, villagers still fish all year, working the stormy Gulf of Alaska for salmon, crab, halibut, cod _ whatever puts food on the table and pays the bills.         ``Fishing was our livelihood,'' Knagin said. ``That still hasn't changed, and it's never going to, I think.''         Other things have changed. The move to Port Lions jolted the villagers into the 20th century. Afognak had no telephones, running water or indoor plumbing. Electricity was produced by small generators, and most homes did without.         Port Lions is crisscrossed by telephone and electric wires. Sewer and water mains run beneath the streets. Trash is picked up every Saturday, and the hilltop satellite dish picks up seven television stations.         ``I've been here 22 years, and I'm still not used to it,'' grumbled Sergay Sheratine, 59, a janitor at the high school, another institution that Afognak never had. ``We were freer in Afognak. We grew our own vegetables. We had our beef cattle, chickens, ducks. Here, the houses are so close together.''         But a new generation has come to love Port Lions as home. Petie Nelson was 7 when the big wave hit. These days, he fishes, hunts and drives out twice a day to meet the mail plane at the Port Lions airstrip.         ``It's a nice place to be,'' he said. ``I wouldn't give it up for any place.''         The town's leaders speak mostly of Port Lions' future, not its traumatic beginning. Their challenge is to provide enough jobs so young people like Petie Nelson don't have to leave the village.         After 22 years, they still hope to bring one more vestige of Afognak to Port Lions _ a turn-of-the-century church built of hand-hewn logs. But Port Lions has two new churches, so the old building won't be used for services. Plans call for it to be a museum, a place for relics of a village that is no more.
