KIRKLAND      Volunteers from the Tzu Chi Foundation's Kirkland branch have collected $180,000 for Taiwan earthquake victims.     About 120 members of the Taiwan-based Buddhist humanitarian group, wearing their trademark blue shirts, took donations last weekend in the International District, the Great Wall Shopping Mall in Kent, downtown Seattle streets near Westlake Center, the Pike Place Market and at the Seattle Super Market  on Beacon Hill.     A bus driver and other motorists got out at red lights to stuff the donation boxes, said Tzu Chi spokeswoman Angela Wan. A few foundation members gave $10,000 each, she said.     Donations may be mailed to Tzu Chi Foundation, 12639 N.E. 85th St., Kirkland, WA 98033. Checks should be marked "Tzu Chi Foundation/Taiwan earthquake."
