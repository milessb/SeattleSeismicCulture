JAKARTA, Indonesia  - A powerful earthquake struck two small, remote islands in eastern Indonesia last night, killing at least six people. Volunteers spent today searching through ruined buildings and landslides for survivors.    Local government officials said at least 153 people were injured and more than 180 homes and buildings were damaged.  Roads were cut and bridges destroyed, hampering search-and-rescue efforts.   Police  said three men and three women had been confirmed dead on worst-hit Mangole Island. No deaths were reported on neighboring Taliabu Island, despite widespread injuries and damage.    Hundreds of people ran to the safety of a soccer field on Mangole after the magnitude-6.5 quake struck last night. Two aftershocks followed. More than 7,000 people were spending today in tents or in the open in fear of their homes collapsing.    Dozens of wooden houses slid into the sea, and landslides destroyed Mangole's main docks.    Mangole, an island dominated by the timber industry, is part of the Maluku archipelago, known in colonial times as the Spice Islands. It has a population of about 38,000.    Neither island has a major hospital. A local government official, Karim Wamona, said emergency flights were taking seriously injured victims to neighboring islands for urgent treatment.   The quake  was centered beneath the Maluku Sea, about 230 miles south of the city of Manado on the island of Sulawesi.Caption:  MAPKNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS: POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE STRIKES INDONESIAN ISLANDS (MAP NOT AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY)
