Soviet officials today denied Western reports that 17 people had been found alive in the city of Spitak on New Year's Eve, 24 days after a massive earthquake Dec. 7 in Armenia.        Norik Muradyan, chief of operations at the government relief and rehabilitation headquarters for Spitak, said the last person to be hospitalized after being pulled alive from the rubble in Spitak was found 10 days ago.        ``The reports of the Western press that allegedly 17 people were found still alive in Spitak on the 24th day after the quake have, unfortunately, no foundation whatsoever,'' Muradyan told the official Tass news agency.        The report, first carried by a French radio station, said that 17 survivors had been found in a collapsed Spitak grain mill and that they had survived on grain and melted snow.        The deputy director of the Armenian Press Agency, A.K. Shakhnazarov, based in the Armenian capital of Yerevan, also said there was no substance to the report.        But Shakhnazarov said rescuers did find a woman in her 40s buried but still alive in the rubble of a bakery in Spitak last Friday, Dec. 30, 23 days after the earthquake.        The unidentified woman survived by eating bread flour but died within minutes of being pulled from the rubble, he said.        He said that since Dec. 29, a total of 28 bodies had been found in Spitak.        Meanwhile, a fresh tremor rocked the earthquake-hit Armenian city of Leninakan on Saturday but caused only minor damage to buildings, an Armenian government official said yesterday.        ``There were no casualties,'' Grachik Vartanyan, head of the government's administrative affairs department said, dismissing a report that six people died.         He said the tremor measured seven points on the 12-point Soviet scale. A seven-point tremor is defined as only strong enough to cause cracks in the walls of stone buildings. The Soviet scale is different from the more widely used 10-point Richter scale.        Last week, Armenian government officials said 24,854 bodies had been recovered and that another 100 to 120 bodies were expected to be pulled from the rubble in coming days. The death toll thus appears to be about half the original official estimate of 55,000 killed.        Heavy snow and fog continued to hamper rebuilding efforts, which the government says will take two years and as much as $13 billion to complete.
