The most recent word from Costa Rica after last week's big earthquake is that travelers shouldn't plan to arrive in the capital, San Jose, and expect to find hotel or bed-and-breakfast lodging without a reservation. Many Costa Ricans from Limon, whose homes were damaged or destroyed by the quake, have moved temporarily into San Jose and rooms are at a premium. Tourism officials say that lodging in destinations outside the city, however, is generally available       Other recent reports say that some Indian villages in the mountains appear to have been destroyed in mudslides brought on by the quake. Travelers to remote areas may experience some complications and problems, but tourism officials and guides say that most destinations have experienced little if any quake-related difficulties.
