By coincidence, only a week after the devastating earthquake in Mexico, President Reagan signed the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act, which had been introduced earlier this year by this state's Sen. Slade Gorton         Gorton's bill will fund several research programs in which scientists from the University of Washington and other institutions will work with the U.S. Geological Survey in seeking better ways of predicting quakes.         Earthquake prediction is an embryonic science, to be sure, but still has progressed beyond mere theory.         Quake-prediction researchers ought to be able to count on regular federal funding at reasonable levels _ such as Gorton's bill provides _ for the foreseeable future.
