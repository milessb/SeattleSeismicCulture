A strong earthquake struck a mountainous region in the southern Soviet Union early today, and officials said at least five children were killed and 25 other people hospitalized.     The quake measured 6.3 on the Richter scale, said Rebecca Phipps, a spokeswoman for the National Earthquake Information Center in Reston, Va.     The Soviet Earthquake Physics Institute in Moscow reported the quake centered near the Georgian city of Bakuriani, about 56 miles northwest of the capital Tbilisi.     Five children were reported killed just outside Gori, about 20 miles northwest of Tbilisi, according to the Georgian republic government. Twenty-five people were reported injured near Gori, the reports said. There were no immediate reports on damage.      Another quake, measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale, occurred yesterday in a sparsely populated region of the Sandwich Islands, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It was centered in the southwest Atlantic Ocean, about 2,200 miles southeast of Buenos Aires, Argentina, Phipps said. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.      And a 5.2-scale temblor rattled northern Japan early today, but no injuries or damage were immediately reported, the Central Meteorological Agency said. The quake was centered on the coast of central Iwate Prefecture (state), the agency said.
