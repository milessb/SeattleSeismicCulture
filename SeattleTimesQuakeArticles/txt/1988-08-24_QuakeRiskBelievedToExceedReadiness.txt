Officials are in the midst of a five-year study they say will show an earthquake risk in Washington, Oregon and British Columbia far higher than the region's quake preparedness efforts would indicate        ``Geologists have long believed that the seismically active Northwest could give birth to a destructive 7.5 magnitude earthquake with the potential for killing many and injuring thousands more,'' according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Northwest regional office in Bothell. ``Such a catastrophic event would cause destruction far beyond that contemplated by today's emergency planning in the Pacific Northwest.        ``There's growing evidence to suggest that parts of Oregon, Washington and the province of British Columbia could be rocked by a `great quake' of magnitude 8 or higher,'' the agency said in a special earthquake statement.        There is no consensus among scientists on when the next major quake will hit or how powerful it will be.        But FEMA and the U.S. Geological Survey are in the second year of a five-year investigation of the dangers earthquakes pose in the Northwest. Washington and Oregon state geologic and emergency offices also are participating, although Idaho is not greatly involved because the study is mainly on the coastal quake danger, FEMA spokesman Phil Cogan said.        Nearly 200 scientists, emergency managers, engineers and other officials attended a federal-state workshop earlier this year to share information about quakes and quake preparedness in the Puget Sound and Portland areas.        ``Experts do agree that earthquakes as large as magnitude 7.5 will continue to occur deep beneath Puget Sound,'' FEMA said. ``Some suggest such events may also occur beneath northwest Oregon.        ``Recent and historic earthquake activity in the Cascade Mountains supports the possibility of earthquakes up to magnitude 7 in the Washington Cascade Mountains, posing the potential for damage in the Portland, Ore., area as well as in Washington,'' FEMA said.        The last major quake in Washington was on April 29, 1965, when a quake of 6.5 on the Richter scale near Renton led to the deaths of eight people and caused $12.5 million in damage - including extensive chimney damage in West Seattle, FEMA said.
