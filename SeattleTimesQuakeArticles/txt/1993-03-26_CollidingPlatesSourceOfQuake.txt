LOS ANGELES - The collision of two gigantic plates of rock in Earth's crust probably was the ultimate cause of the sharp earthquake that yesterday rocked Oregon, a scientist said.     The quake, estimated at magnitude 5.3 to 5.7 on the Richter scale, produced scattered damage in the Willamette Valley, including cracks in the Capitol building in Salem and partial collapse of a school in Molalla.     The quake ruptured an unnamed east-west fault  near the Cascade foothills about  7 miles south of Molalla, said Craig Weaver, a seismologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Seattle.     It was a "thrust" earthquake, meaning that land on one side of the fault moved upward relative to land on the other side of the fault.
