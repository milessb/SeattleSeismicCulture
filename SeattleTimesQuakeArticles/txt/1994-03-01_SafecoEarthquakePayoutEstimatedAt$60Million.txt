SEATTLE - Safeco says estimates of what it must pay from the Jan. 17 Southern California earthquake have been raised to $60 million from $50 million.     Safeco pays the first $50 million in losses plus 10 per cent of any losses between $50 million and $200 million, which is covered by a secondary insurance carrier. The company now expects 8,000 claims totaling between $150 million and $175 million, said Boh Dickey, chief financial officer.
