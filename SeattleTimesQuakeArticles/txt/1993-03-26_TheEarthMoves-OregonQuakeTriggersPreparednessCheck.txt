THE earthquake that rumbled under Oregon, damaging the state Capitol rotunda and partially collapsing two walls at a high school outside Portland, should do more than shake ground and buildings.     It should jolt people and government entities in this state into action. All of us need to be better prepared for a big one or, for that matter, a medium-sized one. Despite years of relative calm, this is earthquake country.     The Puget Sound area experienced quakes of 7.1 and 6.5 on the Richter scale of ground motion in 1949 and 1965, respectively. Those quakes caused widespread moderate damage. Eight people died in 1949; six died in 1965.      In recent years, geologists have discovered evidence of magnitude-8.5 earthquakes off the Washington and Oregon coast as recently as 300 years ago. They also confirmed the "Seattle fault." This runs under Seattle and produced an earthquake 1,100 years ago that pushed landslides into Lake Washington, shoved parts of Alki Point and Whidbey Island upward and created a tsunami on Puget Sound.     Assessments vary as to the preparedness of different agencies to cope. But no one in the know believes this area is truly ready for any major ground-shifting.     The 1989 San Francisco earthquake prompted more jurisdictions to get serious about earthquakes. But more can and should be done.     Gov. Mike Lowry's budget includes $2 million more to help jurisdictions plan and educate people about the risk.     This is essential. Most geologists believe the area is overdue for a major shaker.     It's not just government that needs to be better prepared. Very few people realize they too are responsible for earthquake preparedness. Do you have enough water, food and warm clothing stocked in your car or in an easily accessible area of your home to keep your family going for a minimum of 72 hours
