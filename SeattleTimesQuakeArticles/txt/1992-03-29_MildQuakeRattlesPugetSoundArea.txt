KIRKLAND A mild earthquake centered in Kirkland rattled the Puget Sound area last night, but caused no injuries or damage.     The University of Washington said the 6:54 p.m. quake registered 3.4 on the Richter scale. The tremors may have been felt up to 25 miles away.     "It was large enough to be felt, but that's about it," said Steve Malone, research professor in the geophysics program at the University of Washington.     Earthquakes of similar size have occurred six times in the Kirkland area over the past decade.     The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
