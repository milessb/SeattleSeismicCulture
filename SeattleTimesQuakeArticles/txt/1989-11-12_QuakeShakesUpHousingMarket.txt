SAN JOSE, Calif. - Although panic about possible plunging real-estate values in mountain areas of Northern California has subsided, some major changes are taking place in the housing market in the wake of the Oct. 17 earthquake        Most lenders say they will continue to finance home purchases and rebuilding in quake-ravaged areas, and although post-quake real-estate activity is hardly back to normal, a $500,000 home in the hard-hit Santa Cruz Mountains was sold last Tuesday.        But real-estate experts say they are more likely to require expensive earthquake insurance and in-depth studies by structural and soil engineers as conditions of receiving loans.        As a result, buying or selling a house may be considerably more expensive and time-consuming. A sale pending on a home in a subdivision of exclusive homes is in limbo, said Tom Wilkin, whose Red Carpet office is representing the property. Although the home is not damaged, he said he doubted the buyer or lender would go ahead with the deal - at least for a while.        John Hogan, senior vice president of First Franklin Financial Corp. of San Jose, the largest mortgage banker in Santa Cruz County, said his firm has had only one earthquake-related loan cancellation, by the would-be buyer of an undamaged Watsonville home.        But Hogan said lenders, and investors who buy their loans in the secondary market, will likely require earthquake insurance in many mountain areas - which could easily add several hundred dollars a month to mortgage payments, depending on a home's replacement value.        ``It's not been required in areas such as Boulder Creek and Ben Lomond,'' said Hogan. ``I'm sure that will change, at least for the next year.''        Hogan said First Franklin will still make loans, given that the value of the home is adequately insured. A Minnesota-based buyer of several loans that First Franklin made over the last several weeks flew people out to examine 95 properties, most of which were in the mountains.        ``They told me the pictures on television made it look a lot worse than it was and they were not worried about buying more loans,'' he said.        Hogan and other lenders are also making second mortgage loans to homeowners who need to make major repairs.        Meanwhile, real-estate agents and sellers are being advised by lawyers to cover themselves when selling property anywhere in the area. A lawyer told the Los Gatos-Saratoga Board of Realtors that sellers should hire engineers to examine their properties in order to meet laws requiring disclosure of any earthquake-related problems to the buyer.        ``It's not only for legal reasons,'' said Jeffrey Johns, the board's legislative advocate, ``but agents will have to be sensitive to the psychology of buyers'' who will likely be more assured if the house has passed inspection.        Appraisers are having a particularly tough time making post-quake appraisals. Many are now estimating a home's value but issuing disclaimers that say the effect of the earthquake on property values is unknown.        ``The stigma of the earthquake will vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. If you can say your home came through a 7.1 quake undamaged, that can almost be a selling point. But that is highly judgmental and there is no scientific way to appraise that,'' said San Jose appraiser Norm Hulberg.         Others think the lure of the mountains will remain.    `We've been through earthquakes, mudslides, fires . . . It's the price you pay for living in the mountains.'    Ron Gates    owner, Ridge Properties        Some real-estate agents and appraisers are looking at the market effects of 1984's Morgan Hill earthquake, which measured 6.2 on the Richter scale and rocked five homes near Lake Anderson off their foundations, and the 1982-83 mudslides and 1985 Lexington fire in the Santa Cruz Mountains in predicting what will happen to real-estate values.        In both of those cases, sales in the immediate areas came to a halt for about a month but slowly resumed and returned to normal within a year.
