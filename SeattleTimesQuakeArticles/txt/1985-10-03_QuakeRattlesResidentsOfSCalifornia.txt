REDLANDS, Calif. (UPI) _ Jittery in the wake of the devastating earthquakes that destroyed parts of Mexico City two weeks ago, Southern Californians were rattled by a 5.0 quake, but experts doubt it was related to the Mexican jolts        The moderate earthquake was felt throughout much of Southern California yesterday, swaying skycrapers in Los Angeles 65 miles from the epicenter and causing minor damage in some suburban areas.        ``It scared the hell out of everybody,'' San Bernardino County Sheriff's Sgt. Mike Stodelle said. ``Everybody went scrambling for the doorways and under desks.''        Scientists at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said the epicenter of the quake, which struck at 4:44 p.m. PDT, was six miles southeast of San Bernardino on the San Jacinto fault.
