It's a two-mile stretch of roadway that everyone either loves to hate or hates to love. The top of the Alaskan Way Viaduct offers an unparalleled view of Elliott Bay and the Olympic Mountains, and provides a shortcut to the airport for those who live in neighborhoods on the west side of Seattle. It carries 80,000 vehicles a day, a relief valve for its congested big sister, Interstate 5. But no one disputes it is an engineering nightmare--an elevated roadway, built on watery soil, that could collapse in an earthquake. That it survived Wednesday's 6.8 tremor relatively unscathed is more a matter of luck than design. While there are no plans to replace or upgrade the aging viaduct, the earthquake was a shattering wake-up call, said those involved in transportation planning. The Legislature last year set aside $500,000 to study what to do with the viaduct, and planners are putting the contract out to bid. It was to be an 18-month study, but at least one member of the state Transportation Commission wants it accelerated. "I think it would be foolish not to use this as a way to say, `Gee, maybe we should go faster,' " said commissioner Aubrey Davis, who has been involved in transportation issues for 30 years. He said he was going to ask the commission staff about how the plan could be speeded up. "The real question is what will it do against the Big One," Davis said. The viaduct was built in 1953, following the route of railroad lines that once ran  along the Seattle waterfront. It was intended primarily as a bypass route to divert traffic around the city center. According to a history written by former Seattle city engineer Roy Morse, the viaduct was built with 60,000 yards of concrete, nearly 8,000 tons of steel and 171 feet of pillars. It cost $8 million to build, a fraction of the $400 million estimated to rebuild or rehabilitate it to withstand strong earthquakes.       Fanciful, fruitless proposals Over the years the viaduct has become the target of a number of proposals, some fanciful, all fruitless. Some wanted to build it up, others tear it down. In the mid-1970s, architect Klaus Bodenmueller proposed converting the viaduct into a city hall, art museum and shops. There's been another plan to build a new floating bridge extending into Elliott Bay. In 1974, former City Councilman John Miller--later a congressman--suggested tearing down the viaduct. A decade later former Metro director Neil Peterson led a group that proposed replacing the viaduct with a toll tunnel. The latest proposal, floated by a team of architects, would demolish the viaduct and leave a 9-acre waterfront park. What those architects haven't figured out is what to do with the thousands of cars that use the viaduct each day, except to suggest adding another layer to I-5. Despite all the attention, the viaduct sits virtually unchanged from the day it opened. The only money spent has been on studies--including a major earthquake study done by University of Washington engineers in the mid-1990s. That study found that the viaduct was built on bad soil that could liquefy in an earthquake. Steven Kramer, an engineer who studied the viaduct for the state Department of Transportation, said he found the structure deficient in a number of ways. Not only was there concern about the soil becoming liquid in an earthquake, he said there were a number of problems with the viaduct itself, the joints between the beams and the columns and the way the columns were connected to the foundation.       Engineer wasn't worried When the earth started shaking on Wednesday, Kramer may have been one of the few people not worried about the viaduct. He said the quake didn't seem strong enough to cause worry about liquefaction, adding that doesn't mean the viaduct could withstand a different quake, one centered closer to Seattle and not as deep below the Earth. "What we felt (Wednesday) was three to six times weaker than what we design new structures for," Kramer said. "It was not a strong level of shaking in Seattle. It was noticeable and disconcerting, but we can expect to be shaken much harder than that." Kramer said he knows there's no easy solution, particularly when there's a $400 million price tag on rebuilding the viaduct to earthquake standards. But, he said, "it takes someone to realize there's a hazard and could be a hazard to thousands of people."       Tear-down idea criticized Miller said he proposed tearing down the viaduct after reading an engineering memo that suggested that it might eventually cost too much to maintain it. The proposal was immediately criticized by residents of West Seattle and Magnolia and became an issue in his re-election campaign. "Even when I proposed it most people said it was a mistake to build there, but it's there and it's with us," said Miller. Peterson, who now runs a car-sharing company, said he wanted to replace the viaduct with a toll tunnel. "We were going to take it down because of reasons everyone is aware of: eyesore, noise, pollution," he said. The idea evolved from a 1994 public-private partnership when the state asked the private sector to come in and help solve congestion problems without raising taxes. At the time Peterson had just come back from Los Angeles, where he had been running that city's metro system. "I got religion about earthquakes down there," he said. "What happened (Wednesday) was unbelievably lucky. If it had been another fault, the viaduct would be totally history and a tremendous tragedy. We have to do something about it." Peterson said the state eventually picked six projects to do; the viaduct was No. 7. Ultimately the funding dried up for all but one of the proposals, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.       `Heart-lifting experience' Doing anything with the viaduct won't be easy, both financially and politically, and many people agree with playwright Carl Sander who said he'd hate to lose "that glorious view." "I love it, I've always loved it," he said. "Every time you drive on it you get that eye-opening, heart-lifting experience. You dropped someone off at the airport and it's like a little gift you get for driving. You hate to lose that." Still, Sander said he realized that the viaduct could be very vulnerable in an earthquake and if putting cars underground was the only solution, he would grudgingly accept it. Architect Lee Copeland is one of a group of designers who spent six months dreaming of what it would be like if the viaduct were gone. They came up with a series of drawings depicting parks and other open space. "For most of my career I felt it would be best if there wasn't a viaduct there," he said. "So we thought, let's see if we can raise the issue again." Colleague Dennis Haskell said the viaduct was one of his favorite views of downtown, "but I wouldn't risk people's lives to keep it there nor trade it for the beautiful waterfront people could make use of. It's dark and dreary, not a nice place to be. It could be much more and everybody's screaming for more open space, especially along the waterfront." The DOT study will look at several options for the viaduct: retrofitting it, replacing it with another bridge, building a tunnel. The study will be done through the DOT's Office of Urban Mobility. "Certainly this was a wake-up call to the region," said Mike Cummings, a department planning supervisor in the mobility office. He said not only was there the issue of the viaduct itself but the seawall built along the central waterfront. If the seawall were lost in an earthquake, what would happen to the viaduct? "What is the fatal flaw out there?" Cummings said. "What would go first?" There's no easy fix, people on both side of the issue agree. It could be years before any decision is made, and finding the money to do anything with the viaduct won't be easy. "We've never had the kind of money to repair or retrofit the viaduct," said Davis, with the transportation commission. "We need to figure out whether we need to do it or not and we'd better hurry."
