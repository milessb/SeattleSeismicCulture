An earthquake registering 3.1 on the Richter scale rumbled through rural King County early today, provoking a few calls but causing no damage.        According to Chris Jonietz-Trisler, a University of Washington seismic analyst, the quake was centered in the Duvall-Carnation area and was 4.5 miles beneath the earth's surface. Jonietz-Trisler said the quake hit about 4:05 a.m. and went unnoticed by most residents.          ``There were a couple of calls,'' she said. ``One man said it felt like someone slammed a door and the whole house shook.
