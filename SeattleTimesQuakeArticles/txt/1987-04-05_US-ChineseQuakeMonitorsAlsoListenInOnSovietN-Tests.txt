WASHINGTON _ Earthquake monitors that were installed as part of a U.S.-China scientific agreement also have been gathering information on the size of Soviet nuclear tests, The New York Times reported yesterday         The Pentagon will use data from one such device _ in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region near a Soviet nuclear test site _ and other instruments to improve U.S. monitoring capabilities, the newspaper said.         U.S. experts have long sought a way to monitor Soviet nuclear tests from China, but in the past China has resisted overt efforts at gathering data on Soviet explosions.         A Defense Department spokesman would not comment on the report.         Last year, the Energy Department, which runs the U.S. nuclear testing program, approached the Chinese with a proposal to set up sensitive equipment for monitoring Soviet tests, but the politically sensitive arrangement was scuttled by the Chinese after it was disclosed in budget documents.         One such document by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency said data from seismographs will ``improve our yield estimation'' of Soviet nuclear tests.         According to the document, the data also would help improve the U.S. capability to distinguish nuclear tests from earthquakes, which is necessary to monitor smaller underground tests, The Times reported.         Despite the controversy, the two nations went ahead with a separate project to set up monitoring stations in China, primarily for studying and predicting earthquakes.         The system was set up under an agreement between the U.S. Geological Survey and Chinese government seismologists, with Chinese workers run the monitoring equipment. Officials for the Geological Survey, an agency of the Interior Department, could not be reached for comment.         However, David Russ of the Geological Survey told The Times: ``We look on it as a scientific research project for the study of earthquakes. If a contributor has some other purpose, that is his business. It is not the primary purpose.''         In the past, China has resisted overt U.S. efforts to install devices that would monitor Soviet blasts, The Times said. Despite Chinese ambivalence, the two countries completed the building of nine monitoring stations in China for earthquake prediction.         The two countries share the cost of the network, which is operated under an agreement between Chinese government seismologists and the U.S. Geological Survey.         One device is in Urumqi in Xinjiang, China's northwesternmost province _ about 600 miles from the Soviet test site at Semipalatinsk in Central Asia.         Another site in Manchuria will allow the United States to learn more about the geology of the Soviet Union.
