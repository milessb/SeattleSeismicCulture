NICOSIA, Cyprus - At least 21 villagers were killed, scores injured and more than 12,000 left homeless by a powerful earthquake that jolted a mountainous region of southern Iran, Tehran's official media reported today        They reported a dozen villages damaged, two of them completely destroyed, in the temblor in Fars province last night.        The Islamic Republic News Agency said 21 people were killed, 80 injured and 12,105 rendered homeless. Tehran Radio said 22 were killed and 100 injured.        The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said most of the victims were children sleeping when the quake struck at 9:47 p.m.        The U.S. Geological Survey said initial readings put the magnitude of the quake at 7.0 on the Richter scale. Iran's Geophysics Center of Tehran University said it measured 6.6. A quake of that magnitude is capable of widespread, heavy damage. A quake measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale struck northern Iran on June 21, killing about 50,000 people.        Yesterday's quake was centered near the city of Darab about 600 miles southeast of Tehran, IRNA said. It quoted Darab Gov. Yahya Hashemi as saying at least 12 villages were heavily damaged.        IRNA reported a series of aftershocks well after the earthquake, including a powerful one that hit this morning and measured 5.6 on the Richter scale.        IRNA said helicopters, ambulances, fire engines and civil-defense teams were dispatched to the area. The rescuers, it said, worked all night in search of victims. The helicopters lifted blankets and tents to the area, and flew casualties to hospitals.        President Hashemi Rafsanjani dispatched Vice President Hamid Mirzadeh to the region after allocating $13 million to the stricken area.        The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. An increase of one number on the scale means a 10-fold increase in ground motion.
