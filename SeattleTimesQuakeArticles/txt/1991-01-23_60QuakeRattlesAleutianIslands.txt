A strong earthquake rocked Alaska's Aleutian Islands yesterday but caused no serious damage or injuries.        The earthquake, measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale, had its epicenter on the ocean floor about 10 miles north of the island of Amchitka, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey said.        The Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer said the quake was preceded by two lighter tremors in the area: one measuring 4.4, centered 70 miles northwest of Valdez;  and another measuring 3.6, centered about 30 miles northwest of Valdez.
