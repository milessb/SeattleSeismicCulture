VICTORIA, B.C.         An earthquake shook northern Vancouver Island Friday night, the third temblor along Canada's West Coast in less than a week. No damage or injuries were reported.        Gary Rogers of the Pacific Geoscience Center said the latest quake measured 5 on the Richter scale and was felt in parts of the sparsely populated northern part of the island.        Despite two quakes earlier in the week, Rogers said there was no evidence of increased seismic activity or sign that a major quake was likely soon.
