In your Jan. 19 business section, you erroneously report that repairing earthquake damage in Japan will be a boost to Japan's economy. This disastrous earthquake represents a destruction of wealth, not a boon to the economy. The "gains" of rebuilding are not a boon to the economy, but a figment of the flawed economic statistics that fail to account for disaster losses. That we routinely establish government economic policy based upon flawed government statistics which fail to account for d isaster losses is a major scanda     If you sincerely believe that rebuilding after a disaster is a boon to the economy, then I'm sure you consider arsonist Paul Keller's destruction sufficient to anoint him as an economic miracle worker. Why, oh why, did we put him in jail? We now realize that the failure of the Kingdome ceiling and the sinking of the old Interstate 90 bridge were all economic boons to King County. Indeed, instead of repairing the Kingdome, the county should have blown it up! The resulting rebuild would have shown up in the following years' economic statistics as robust growth.     With this kind of thinking, why stop at simple solutions? Let's enlist the U.S. Army to conduct target practice on downtown Seattle. I'm sure the Navy could easily sink a few more floating bridges and an occasional ferry boat.          Let's hope that the killer quake hits Seattle soon. Just think of the economic growth our region will experience! Let's put a stop to wasteful U.S. Geological Survey earthquake prediction research immediately and instead, begin work on artificially stimulating huge economy-boosting quakes, slides and floods. Let's put our government resources to work on something really useful!      Then again, maybe the government bean counters could start producing meaningful economic statistics, but where's the fun in that? Ed Mitchell Issaqu
