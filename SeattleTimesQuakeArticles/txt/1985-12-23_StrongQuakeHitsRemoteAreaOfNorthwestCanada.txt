EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) _ Christmas trees swayed and beds shook, but no injuries or serious damage were reported in a big earthquake that shook northwestern Canada.        Willi Jacobs of the U.S. National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said the quake measured 6.9 on the Richter scale and was centered about 320 miles west of the Northwest Territories capital of Yellowknife. The quake lasted several seconds, beginning about 9:15 p.m. yesterday.        It was felt as far west as Juneau, Alaska, as far east as Lloydminster on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border and as far south as Spokane, Wash., some 1,200 miles from the epicenter, said officials in Canada and George Carte of the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaksa.        The quake occurred in an area that was rattled by a quake of magnitude 6.6 on Oct. 5.        Jacobs said earthquakes of such magnitude can cause severe damage. But it was unlikely this one would because of the sparse population around the earthquake's center. He said temblors of that magnitude are common in that area.        ``The building was rocking from side to side, the plants were swinging and the Christmas tree swayed,'' said Dave Pawiuk, who lives on the 16th floor of a downtown Edmonton apartment building.        Some city residents fled into the streets, fearing their buildings were going to collapse.        ``It's a big one,'' said geophysicist Edo Nyland at the University of Alberta. ``This looks like the biggest shock that's come through Edmonton.'
