VANCOUVER, Wash. - Mount St. Helens is calming down.    After a marked increase in the number of earthquakes from May through mid-July, scientists said  yesterday that quake activity at the volcano is subsiding.    The number of quakes recorded in July was 445, compared with 318 in June.     But most of July's quakes occurred during the first three weeks of the month, the U.S. Geological Survey Cascades Volcano Observatory said.    There's only been an average of four quakes per day for the past two weeks, the observatory said.    Levels of volcanic gases have also decreased since June.         Scientists say an increase in quakes - particularly those close to the surface - can be an early indicator of a possible eruption.    There have been several periods of increased earthquake activity since the last dome-building eruption in October 1986 - but this summer's was the most intense.    On May 18, 1980, a massive eruption killed 57 people and destroyed 230 square miles of forest, leaving a gaping crater in place of the mountain's once cone-shaped summit.     Since then, smaller eruptions have built a lava dome inside that crater.
