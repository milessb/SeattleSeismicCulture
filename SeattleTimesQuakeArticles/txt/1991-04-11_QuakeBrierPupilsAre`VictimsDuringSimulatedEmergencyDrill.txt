BRIER - Remember, this was only a test.      An earthquake registering 7.5 on the Richter scale struck southwest Snohomish County yesterday, killing one dummy and seriously injuring six pupils. Sort of.      Working with the county's Emergency Services Coordinating Agency (ESCA), the Edmonds School District and Stevens Hospital participated in a earthquake drill. The event was part of the agency's annual exercise in preparation for such a disaster.      A recent study published in the journal Science made the drill more timely by indicating the coastal edge of Washington is being compressed, putting the Puget Sound area at risk for a major earthquake. Don't start packing yet, however: The researchers say severe quakes strike the area about every 600 years, and the last one hit 300 years ago.      Although similar ESCA operations were going on throughout the district, Brier Terrace Middle School was picked to bear the brunt of the "damage."         Emergency officials from local police and fire departments were on hand, and reporters were taken to the staging area - an eighth-grade classroom where the quake had wreaked its imaginary havoc.      Desks were strewn about the room. Students, their clothes and hair matted with fake blood, lay under or alongside them. Their injuries looked real enough.      Chris Bender, 13, was supposed to have been felled by an overhead projector. Lili Teh, 14, had been outfitted with a burned hand. Tim Waller, 14, lay on the floor with what appeared to be a shard of glass protruding from his arm.      A desk that apparently had fallen backward had crushed a stuffed dummy dressed as a student. This was the fatality.      The students, on request, cried for help. They cried for their mothers. But in the moments before firefighters arrived, they mostly cried for Snohomish County Medic 7 paramedic Vince Schweizter to squirt more fake blood on them.   "This is all fun, I agree," Schweitzer told them. "But it's for a real serious reason."      Three firefighters burst in at 10:20 a.m., taking those able to walk away in school buses. The rest moaned in feigned pain while teacher Lisa Garrison tried to comfort them.      Emergency workers sorted out the six most seriously injured before paramedics carted them away on stretchers to Stevens Hospital, which was also participating in the drill. Ten others suffered moderate injuries and 14 had minor injuries.      "It's really cool that we're preparing for that," said 14-year-old Maryam Khalid, referring to the possibility of a severe earthquake. "If it comes, it will be good to be ready for it."   Still, you can't prepare for everything. At exactly 10:45 a.m., the school's pre-programmed educational channel kicked in on a TV monitor above Garrison's desk. Someone quickly punched it off.      "We've been told by the department of seismology at the University of Washington that our area can expect a major earthquake," said Mark Von Borstel, environmental-services manager for the Edmonds district, which holds monthly quake drills - without the fanfare. "We'd better just be prepared.
