HAYWARD, Calif. - An earthquake-monitoring system believed capable of giving students enough notice to take cover under their desks before severe ground shaking occurs has been installed at a Hayward high school - a first in Northern California         The device, put in two weeks ago, is triggered by seismic waves that will activate a siren at Tennyson High School and a recorded message to tell the 1,220 students to: ``Drop, cover, hold.''         How much warning will depend on the distance from the quake's epicenter. At best, the system will provide only a few seconds warning, but experts say any warning is better than none.
