MEXICO CITY _ A major earthquake measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale shook Mexico City and coastal states for about 65 seconds early today, sending terrified residents of areas damaged in last September's deadly quakes fleeing into the streets in pajamas and bathrobes        But the 1:30 a.m. temblor apparently caused only minor damage and no injuries.        The quake also was felt in the Pacific-coast states of Guerrero, Colima and Jalisco, which include the resort cities of Acapulco, Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta.        In Puerto Vallarta, the quake was felt only slightly, but Red Cross officials reported that tourists ran out of hotels and stayed in the streets for a while before returning indoors.        The quake set buildings swaying in downtown Mexico City and in the Colonia Roma, one of the neighborhoods hardest hit during the Sept. 19-20 quakes, in which at least 9,500 people died. The main quake then measured about 8 on the Richter scale.        The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., said the earthquake was centered about 250 miles southwest of the capital near the coastal town of Lazaro Cardenas, on the Guerrero-Michoacan state line _ about the same epicenter as the September quakes.        The Astronomy Institute in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city, placed the epicenter in the state of Colima near an active volcano, the 13,000-foot Nevado de Colima.        The National Autonomous University of Mexico's seismological center also measured two aftershocks about an hour later registering 5.0 and 4.8.         In Mexico City, there was no apparent structural damage and only scattered power outages. But in the Colonia Roma, people huddled along curbs or in grassy median strips, reluctant to go indoors despite reassurances from officials.        Demolition work and cleanup from the September earthquake _ a round-the-clock project in some parts of downtown Mexico City for the past seven months _ continued under the eye of nervous municipal and tourism officials, who had hoped all fear of quakes would be gone in time for the World Cup soccer playoffs in June.
