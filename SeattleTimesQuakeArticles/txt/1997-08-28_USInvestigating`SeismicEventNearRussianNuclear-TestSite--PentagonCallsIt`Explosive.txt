WASHINGTON - The United States said today that a "seismic event" took place 12 days ago in the vicinity of a Russian nuclear-test site and it was trying to determine whether a test blast had been carried out     "We are aware that a seismic event with explosive characteristics occurred in the vicinity of the Russian nuclear-test range at Novaya Zemlya on 16 August," a Pentagon spokeswoman, Air Force Lt. Col. Queenie Byars, said.     "We are not able to determine at this point whether or not a nuclear test has taken place."      Byars said  no conclusions had been reached about whether Russia had breached a self-imposed nuclear-testing moratorium.     The Washington Times, which first reported the detected event, cited Clinton-administration officials as saying Moscow was maintaining that it was an underwater earthquake. Novaya Zemlya is a large island in the Barents Sea.     "We are seeking a clarification from Moscow," the paper quoted a spokesman for the U.S. Arm Control and Disarmament Agency as saying.     Russia expressed surprise today at the U.S. report and denied it had carried out an atomic test. "No nuclear tests were carried out at Novaya Zemlya," a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Ministry said. "Russia has voluntarily given up nuclear testing and sticks to this position."        If confirmed, a blast could fuel opposition in the Republican-led Senate to ratification of the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which would bar tests of nuclear weapons.      The treaty  has been signed by the five declared nuclear-weapons powers: the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia - but not approved by the Senate.
