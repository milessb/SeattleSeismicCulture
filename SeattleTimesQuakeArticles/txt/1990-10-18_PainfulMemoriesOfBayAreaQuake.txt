Dolores Salgado turns away in tears from ceremonies in Oakland yesterday marking the first anniversary of the Bay Area earthquake. Salgado, who lives near the Cypress Freeway that collapsed in the quake, spent 13 days helping with relief efforts. Today, a year and a day after the Bay Area disaster, a quake shook the heavily populated Costa Mesa area, southwest of Los Angeles. The quake smashed some windows but there were no reports of casualties or extensive damage.Caption:  PHOTOREUTERS: PAINFUL MEMORIES OF BAY AREA QUAKE
