MEXICO CITY _ In parts of the city, people carrying pails stood in one long line at tank trunks to get fresh water, then queued up at makeshift outdoor cafeterias for food. Others huddled for warmth in tattered blankets on sidewalks        Yet, just blocks from the areas devastated by the earthquakes, hotel guests took hot showers, then went to dinner in candlelit restaurants.        While some residents worked tirelessly at clearing debris, others went to their regular jobs just as if nothing happened.        ``Even though the size of the damage is important, it is small''  compared to the size of the city, said Jose Barroso, of the Mexican Red Cross. Even though 2,000 may be dead, he said, ``that is small compared with the 17 million in the city.''        The media have not given a true picture of the city's problems, he said. Pictures of the areas devastated by earthquakes have given the impression that much of the city has been destroyed.        ``I am asking if it would be possible to convey the reality in Mexico,'' Barroso said.        In reality, most of the city is functioning well. The streets are filled with traffic. Buses are running and stores are open. Most of the city has food and water, and phones work most of the time for local calls.        Those who now have no home are being fed by the Mexican Red Cross at shelters set up around the devastated areas. On Saturday, boxes of frozen food were being unloaded by a group of teen-age volunteers who had set up a human chain to pass the food from a refrigerated truck into the Red Cross kitchen where it would be prepared. Then it would be loaded into trucks and ambulances to be distributed to the neighborhoods.        ``We're sending out sandwiches and other food that doesn't need to be cooked since these people have nowhere to cook,'' said Rosa Marie Mendez, Mexican Red Cross vice president. ``The hotels are sending food already prepared.''        In a room at the Red Cross headquarters, food was piled high. Loaves of bread were pushed and twisted against the windows. Boxes of canned goods filled the floor.        ``We don't need any more food,'' Mendez said.        At night, the poor homeless sleep in the streets and in the parks, the more fortunate in hotels. During the day, those whose homes or businesses were destroyed work to clean up the mess. Others go to their regular jobs.        The social life of the city went on, too. Men and woman dressed in tuxedos and sequined dresses waited in the lobby of a hotel to attend a party as military troops _ assigned to guard nearby damaged buildings _ came in and out to use the phone.        And on Saturday evening a wedding took place as planned. Southern Methodist University students Eddie and J.C. Safa thought the wedding might be called off after Thursday's quake, but flew to Mexico City anyway.        ``We didn't know what was on,'' said Eddie, 23, an SMU business major.        They found all of their Mexico City relatives, including their mother and father, were safe, and wedding guests from around Mexico City and the United States were waiting.        The wedding went on as planned.        As Barroso said, ``Life goes on in the city.'Caption:  PHOTOUPI / REUTERS: A HOMELESS MOTHER COMFORTS HER DAUGHTER ON A MEXICO CITY SIDEWALK.
