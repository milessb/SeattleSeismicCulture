It is in the finest U.S. tradition to go to the aid of a neighbor in trouble. Our neighbor to the south is in deep trouble, and Uncle Sam of course is responding to help Mexico dig out from its earthquake disaster         In addition to an official government offer of emergency assistance, agencies such as the Red Cross and the Pan American Health Organization are attempting to put uncounted individual offers to best use.         The International Monetary Fund does well to reconsider a scheduled move to cut off loans to Mexico. Similar relief was granted Chile after a major quake struck there last March.         Without question, without hesitation, Mexico merits not just the sympathy of the Western industrial world, but efficiently administered help.
