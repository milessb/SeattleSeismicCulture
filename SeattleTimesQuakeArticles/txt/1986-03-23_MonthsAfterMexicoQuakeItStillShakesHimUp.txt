MEXICO CITY _ He dreamed of dawn and the sun as he lay on the body of a dead colleague beneath the rubble, fearing death and longing for water. He heard a rescuer say his life didn't matter, but searchers finally reached him after four days        Mexico's lethal earthquake last Sept. 19 buried Jose Juan Hernandez Cruz, a medical intern, in the rubble of the Juarez Hospital and killed anywhere from 9,500 to 20,000 people in Mexico City.        Hernandez, now back at work, remembers it all and is writing a book about his experience.        As the earthquake shook the 12-story hospital tower at 7:19 a.m. that Thursday six months ago, he laughed with the five other doctors making rounds in the orthopedic ward. They told the terrified patients to be calm, that it would be over soon.        ``The biggest shock was the fall,'' he recalls. ``Another was finding that none of the other doctors who were with me were alive.        ``I called out, `Doctor! Doctor! Here I am! Hear me!' At that instant, there was silence. Then screams.''        He cried out for help, lying face down in a mass of broken concrete slabs, twisted metal reinforcing rods and the wreckage of a bed, on top of one body and surrounded by others.        His ordeal was to last four full days, one of them his 23rd birthday.        The second quake, on Friday night, was worse for him. It made his space smaller, so that he couldn't turn his body. He couldn't see what was happening around him, but he could hear, and that created some of his greatest agonies.        He heard rescue teams reach other trapped victims, and he shouted in vain for help and water. Chiefs of Mexican rescue teams told their men on two occasions that they must abandon the attempt if they didn't reach him in half an hour.        One team leader told one of his men: ``Many people are already dead. If another dies it doesn't matter,'' Hernandez remembers.        A French team, frequently arguing to be allowed more time, tunneled through to him in an effort that took 29 1/2 hours. The Frenchmen passed him water and a lamp, but then their saws broke on a stubborn reinforcing rod.        They couldn't cut the rod but finally managed to bend it. Hernandez crawled through to the open and collapsed on a stretcher, at 5:27 a.m. Monday, to shouts of ``Bravo!'' Television cameras recorded the event.        He was treated for abrasions on his wrists and chest and had one finger repaired by surgery, But Hernandez was among the lucky ones. In all, 584 people were killed at the hospital.        The cataclysm of September has different echoes in another part of town.        Residents at the enormous Tlatelolco apartment complex have been spending most of their time wringing concessions from the governmnet on housing conditions.        The hope now is that their efforts will benefit others left homeless by the dual quakes _ a figure estimated at 200,000.        Tlatelolco is one of the largest housing developments in Latin America, normally accommodating 30,000 people.        During the quake, two of the huge high-rise buildings collapsed and another 11 were damaged beyond repair. The government, in an apparent panic no less than that suffered by the quake victims first hand, gave almost immediate orders that all two dozen blocks in the complex should be demolished. It gave no word as to what would be the fate of the surviving residents.        So forceful was the residents' response that the official who gave the order was removed from power _ a rare example of the Mexican government at such a high level admitting to mistakes in the face of grass-roots criticism.        Last week, the Tlatelolco residents also won concessions that most of their blocks are habitable. What was even better, the government agreed to begin repairing them.Caption:  PHOTOAP: DR.
