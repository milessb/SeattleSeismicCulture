SAN FRANCISCO - Three days after the earthquake, a university professor who lives in Berkeley began to imagine that she had throat cancer. Her throat was sore, and her lymph nodes swollen; perhaps it was lymphoma, or a tumor          She dreamed a doctor told her she had liver cancer because he saw spots along her arm. She wept, and was afraid to work or go out or put on her clothes in the morning. When she called a friend to talk, she found her friend was frightened, too.        Her friend was afraid of arthritis. An arthritis flare-up had begun hurting the friend's legs, and she had become convinced that she would be unable to walk, that she would have to get a wheelchair, that she would never hike or go outdoors again.          And then the friends called other people they knew, men and women who survived the earthquake with homes and families entirely intact, and what they found all around them was a kind of fear and grief that swelled even in people who thought it was just another earthquake.        A social-service worker weeps each night, and rises on the hour to attend her waking 4-year-old son. An attorney cries as she watches TVnews, and then goes to bed and cannot fall asleep.        ``We're fine, my house is fine, my friends are fine,'' said Linda Bytof, the attorney who cries at the television news, and the way she said this, as she sat at an Oakland BART station and watched the place where morning traffic ought to have been streaming toward the Bay Bridge, showed that was not exactly fine at all.         She feels strange, she said. She cannot concentrate. She forgets what she was talking about. She looks at the pictures of the ripped concrete and smashed automobiles and houses listing wildly to one side, and her own good fortune makes her feel both blessed and utterly askew.        ``I have all these clients that live in Watsonville and Santa Cruz, and everything's devastated, and so you feel both lucky and also guilty,'' she said. ``You don't know what's going to end up happening. It's hard to get back to work. . . .''        Hotlines have been set up along the full reach of the earthquake zone so that people can talk about how they feel, and the counselors spend a lot of their time listening to voices that sound like Bytof's.         ``Many people are afraid to be alone,'' said Catherine Smallwood, director of the Bay Area Crisis Counseling Service. ``They're experiencing sleeplessness, they're experiencing panic attacks, they're experiencing guilt for surviving, they're experiencing just anxiety.''        Many of the Crisis Counseling Service's calls, Smallwood said, are coming from other counseling professionals who have been startled this week by the ferocity of their own emotions.         ``It's very difficult for people who help others to deal with the fact that they need help too,'' Smallwood said. ``It's a loss of control. No one really can control the earth. That's a major issue with everyone - the suddenness of it, and the unpredictability of it.''              For a week, this area has been obsessed by earthquake, with the television clips and newspaper photographs showing again and again the worst of the wreckage.         ``People who knew me were confiding they felt vulnerable to things,'' said the university professor who found herself distraught about cancer. ``They were re-experiencing the moments they felt most threatened, and the most endangered. It wasn't vague. It was when they felt the most endangered in their lives.''         Counselors attending the telephone lines here have said this kind of distress is not unusual.        ``That's a common symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder, where a past crisis or a particular problem is now becoming the identified stress instead of the earthquake,'' said Phil Becker, a psychologist with the Mental Health Crisis Service in Contra Costa County, on the east side of the Bay Bridge.         ``My way of looking at it is that it's really not post-traumatic stress disorder as much as it's a kind of neurotic reaction to earthquake - `I can't admit to myself that I'm really scared about the earthquake, because I live in a place where there's earthquakes all the time.' ''        There are thousands of people here for whom the earthquake really has disrupted almost everything that used to seem familiar.          ``I'm feeling numb, and what I've done, I think, is just emotionally shut down,'' said Barbara Miller, a management consultant who was standing in the rain outside the broken stucco facade of the two-story house where, until Oct. 17, she both lived and maintained her office.         ``I am not allowing myself to feel anything at all. I want to leave. I want to walk away. It just feels like such a burden to have to deal with it.''        Inside her house, Miller said, nearly everything she owns is on the floor and broken into pieces. ``There's nothing standing,'' she said, her voice starting to give way.         A San Francisco Chronicle poll after the earthquake found that 9 percent of the 600 randomly selected Bay Area and Santa Cruz residents said they were ``thinking about moving away,'' and that 3 percent of the total poll group said the earthquake had prompted ``definite plans to move away.''         But the university professor observed that other parts of the country have geologic faults too; the biggest recorded earthquake in American history occurred 177 years ago in a town in Missouri.        ``Seattle is supposed to be waiting for an earthquake - another wonderful place,'' she said. She talks to the man she lives with about moving to New York, but in New York she believes she would live with fear on the subway every day, and neither that nor the prospect of life in a place she loathes are trade-offs she is willing to make.        ``This is my home,'' Dodds said, her hands jammed into her pants pockets as she stood at the entrance to her cracked living room. ``People rebuild their homes in Mexico City. They rebuild their homes all over the world where there are active crusts.''        Dodds was raised in the Bay Area, and she works in Berkeley, and most of her family lives within an hour's drive of her condominium. She knows now that there is something dangerous about the landfill under the Marina, that houses nine blocks west were nearly undamaged by the earthquake, but even that has not convinced her to abandon the neighborhood she loves.        ``Your emotions don't always do the logical thing,'' she said. ``Maybe I'll move, five or six years down the road. But this is my house. And this is where I'll rebuild.'
