MIAMI--A Miami-Dade County emergency-response team took critical supplies to El Salvador yesterday, a day after an earthquake buried thousands of homes in the Central American nation. The emergency aid, coordinated by the U.S. Agency for International Development, included 25,000 pounds of blankets, medical kits, drinking water and plastic tarps for makeshift shelters. A five-member Disaster Assistance Response Team will distribute supplies and help assess damage and needs in El Salvador. The magnitude 7.6 quake Saturday left more than 300 people dead and some 1,200 missing. "We bring in the supplies, we coordinate with authorities there," U.S. AID spokesman Chris Madison said. "People have been taken out of their homes, so what you need is water, shelter. We use plastic sheeting; you can protect people from the elements with that." Both the supplies and emergency team are from the Miami-Dade Urban Search and Rescue Team, a 250-member group that has responded to flooding and earthquake disasters from Mexico to Turkey to Mozambique. The specialized squad was tapped by U.S. AID last June to be the federal agency's quick-response team for countries damaged by hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters. The emergency supplies were prepackaged and ready to go at Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami. Costa Rica and Mexico also sent help in the first hours after the disaster. Rene Leon, El Salvador's ambassador to the U.S., said  individuals wishing to assist should donate cash rather than food or clothing because of the logistical difficulties of getting the items to the stricken area. He provided two International Red Cross numbers for those wishing to help, 1-800-HELP NOW, and, for Spanish speakers, 1-800-257-7575.
