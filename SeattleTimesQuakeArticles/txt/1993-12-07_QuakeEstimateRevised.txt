KLAMATH FALLS, Ore. - An incomplete tally of damage to downtown buildings has reached $220,000 as scientists revise their estimate of the weekend earthquake in southern Oregon.     Seismologists now put the magnitude of Saturday's quake at between 5.1 and 5.3. They give no assurances that the latest significant aftershock to a series of quakes that hit Sept. 20 would be the last.     It could be six months to a year before the earthquakes die down, said Ian Madin, a seismic-hazard geologist with the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries.     Alan Barnes, director of the Klamath County Building Department, said reports of damage to downtown still were coming in and that the $220,000 figure didn't include additional damages to the Klamath County Courthouse, which has been closed since the first quake in September.     Repairs to the courthouse following the first quake were estimated at more than $3 million.     At least eight downtown buildings were damaged this time. Among them was the Pelican Hotel, which lost bricks that fell on the building housing Beyond Comics, where the ceiling collapsed. Police allowed traffic to resume on Main Street, which had been shut off over the weekend because of fears of falling bricks.
