KHABAROVSK, Russia - Earthquake survivors huddled around bonfires amid the rubble of their ruined homes today, refusing to leave trapped friends and families. Rescuers worked through the night under the glare of emergency floodlights at the remote oil town in Russia's Far Eas    As the search entered its third day, almost 1,000 survivors had been found and nearly 400 bodies recovered from what was left of the Sakhalin Island oil town of Neftegorsk, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.    Officials feared the death toll from the magnitude 7.5 quake, one of the strongest in Russia's history, could surpass 2,000. They said the flattened town would not be rebuilt.    "When the sun sets, . . .  the town starts moaning," Russian television reported. "These are the moans of those buried under the rubble."     Television showed horrifying footage of a man, apparently pinned down under the ruins of his bed by concrete debris that covered his entire upper body, kicking his exposed legs feebly in a futile bid to extricate himself.     Bodies lay on the ground under blankets, and cloth scraps and limbs poked out of the rubble as cranes hoisted concrete slabs from mountains of debris.         The dead now appear to outnumber the living in what little is left of the remote oil town that was once home to 3,200 people. Rescuers so far have found 372 people alive - and 377 bodies.    With temperatures dropping below freezing at night, rescuers feared that few of the entombed could survive much beyond today.         "Rescue work can help save victims only in the first two or three days," said Sergei Khetagurov, deputy minister for emergency situations. "After that, there is no one left to save."     Mikhail Yalch, 42,  told ITAR-Tass there was no time to react when the quake struck early Sunday morning.    "My 12-year-old son, Anton, and I were watching TV, when one powerful shock threw me off the sofa and the ceiling crashed down," Yalch said. "I woke up in complete darkness and discovered that I was in a small, narrow hole between two panels, and that my legs were hopelessly pinned down."     Yalch, whose wife also survived, said he later found his son dead on the sofa.  "We lost in one day all that was so precious: Our son, our home, our health, our peace of mind and confidence in the future."     Another survivor said he hacked himself free with a small saw, then dug out his daughter with the saw and his bare hands. "I saw my daughter's hand and heard her voice: `Daddy, I'm here.' It took me 3 1/2 hours to get her out," he told NTV television.    Relief supplies, field hospitals and hundreds of rescue workers were being rushed to Neftegorsk aboard helicopters and small planes. An ice-breaker was sent to clear a path for a hospital ship.    Getting help to the victims posed a major logistical problem. The nearest airport that can accommodate large cargo planes is 400 miles away in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, at the southern end of the island.    Fog and poor roads compound the transportation problems.    In Moscow, President Boris Yeltsin offered his condolences on nationwide television and announced that tomorrow would be a national day of mourning.    "I know that you are doing all you can and even more than is humanly possible," Yeltsin appealed to rescuers. "But still, while there is hope, please, I ask you, remember that each hour, each minute, may be the last one for those who are still under the ruins of the buildings."     The quake was the worst in the former Soviet Union since a 1988 earthquake in Armenia killed at least 25,000 people.     Sunday's quake was centered offshore near Sakhalin's thinly populated northern tip, and Neftegorsk was 40 miles northwest of the epicenter.    The injured were being taken from Neftegorsk to hospitals in the regional center of Okha and to cities on the mainland, including Khabarovsk, 500 miles away.    News reports said the tremor destroyed about 20 five-story brick buildings dating from the 1960s, when Soviet construction was especially shoddy.    Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets called the decision to build a town in such an active earthquake zone "ill-considered."      "The nature of the destruction in this small town shows the decision to build here was not properly thought out," Soskovets said.     Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu said the earlier buildings reflected the then-widespread belief that the region was not part of an earthquake zone. Homes built after 1972 were more strongly built, he said.     Construction-ministry expert Valery Abarykov said  the older buildings in Neftegorsk had not been in a condition to withstand a major shock even when new.     "The situation was only made worse by almost three decades' use, metal corrosion and aging of the concrete. These buildings would not have withstood a quake of even half the strength," he said.     Poor Soviet-era construction work is often blamed for high death tolls during earthquakes and other natural disasters in the former Soviet Union, such as the Armenian quake.     Alexander Sidorin, head of the seismological laboratory at Russia's Institute of Physics, said authorities had consistently ignored recommendations to improve the quality of buildings.     "Year after year specialists presented the results of their investigations and demanded buildings in towns be strengthened to help them withstand underground tremors," he told Itar-Tass news agency.     "But as a rule, money shortages meant the seismologists' recommendations were not taken into account."     The temblor ruptured a 60-mile section of oil pipeline in 15 places and damaged several oil wells. The pipeline has been shut off, but although the extent of the spill is not yet known, government and oil company executives said yesterday the damage was not significant.   Soskovets said he expected the oil fields to resume normal operations within days. He said oil workers would be brought in from the mainland from now on
