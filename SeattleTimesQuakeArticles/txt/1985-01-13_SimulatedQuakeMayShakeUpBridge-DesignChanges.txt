WASHINGTON _ Sometime next spring, the ground will rumble in Gaithersburg, Md., a Washington suburb where earthquakes are not indigenous.         A force of several million pounds will press and pull down on three 30-foot-high bridge columns weighing 250 tons. Eventually, under gradually increasing levels of energy that are expected to exceed the equivalent of 8.25 on the Richter scale, those concrete columns will be destroyed. The only question is exactly how much time, and how much force, it will take.         This simulated earthquake will be controlled by a computer and by scientists at the National Bureau of Standards, which is building the largest seismic test facility of its kind in the U.S. The test, jointly funded by the National Science Foundation, the Federal Highway Administration and the California Department of Transportation, is intended to evaluate bridge design changes implemented after a severe earthquake in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles struck in 1971. During that quake, which measured 6.5 on the Richter scale, five bridges collapsed and 42 others were seriously damaged.         The design changes, which required stronger steel reinforcement, have never been tested at full strength.         ``One way of getting that information is to wait for the next earthquake. A better way is to test it in the lab, where you've got the ability to control the loads,'' said Charles Culver, chief of the National Bureau of Standards' structures division. ``This project will give us bench-mark data, something we didn't have before, a point of reference to compare other data. It should help us develop improved criteria for designing bridges and buildings to better resist earthquake damage.''         A universal testing machine, capable of exerting up to 12 million pounds of force, will be used to press down on the bridge columns. It will simulate what in reality would be the weight of the actual bridge and traffic traveling across it. A specially designed hydraulic jack, known as a bi-directional actuator, will be used to produce the lateral forces of an earthquake at the base of the bridge columns.         ``That piston will push the bottom of the column back and forth, back and forth _ a movement which is the simulation of a real earthquake,'' Culver said.         Bureau scientists think it may take as long as two days for the columns to topple as the force gradually builds.         ``We want to create the destruction of the bridge from an earthquake, like in San Fernando, but we're hoping we won't see the same mode of failure,'' said National Bureau of Standards structural engineer William Stone, who designed the facility. ``We think the same size column will be able to withstand a much greater earthquake.''         Dozens of sensitive instruments will be embedded within the columns and attached to their exteriors to record all the energy absorption levels from the start of the experiment to the ultimate destruction of the ``bridge.''         ``It's going to fail gradually, not like it does all of a sudden in a real earthquake,'' Culver said. ``We'll be able to see exactly how the specimen gets weaker and weaker under the load. This will provide us with some very useful information.''         Culver said he believes this is the first time a test will be performed on a life-size column. ``Most of the research done on the behavior of bridge columns has been done on much smaller specimens and extrapolated to predict full-scale behavior,'' he said.         But no one has ever known for sure if these tests accurately predict the real thing. To test whether they do, researchers in a smaller facility at the bureau will test columns of one-third and one-sixth size while other scientists are testing the full 30-foot columns.         The tests will be compared to determine if those performed on the smaller columns produce comparable results. If they do, bureau officials said, such models undoubtedly will help the construction industry design safer buildings and bridges without the need for more elaborate and expensive experiments.         Bureau officials said they expect the facility to be completed by the end of 1984 and be ready for initial tests early next year. The first full-scale experiment is scheduled for spring 1985.         ``Concrete under compression can be extremely explosive when it fails,'' he said. ``We may have a very exciting ending.'
