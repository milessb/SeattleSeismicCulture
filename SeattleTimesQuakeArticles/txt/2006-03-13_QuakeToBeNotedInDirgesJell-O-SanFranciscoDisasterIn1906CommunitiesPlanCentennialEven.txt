SANTA ROSA, Calif. — Communities up and down the San Andreas fault are going all out to make sure they aren't overlooked in the centennial of the 1906 Great Quake, the disaster that killed about 700 people and left San Francisco in ruins. Some events seek to evoke solemn memories of the quake's victims. In Santa Rosa, which was a farm town of 7,500 residents when the San Andreas snapped and lurched April 18, 1906, a band will play dirges as 119 volunteers dressed in vintage garb walk by candlelight behind a horse-drawn hearse. The procession will begin at 5:13 a.m. April 18, the time the ground started jumping 100 years ago. The Great Quake killed 119 people in Santa Rosa, the highest quake-related death toll per capita of any American city before or since. "We thought it would make something kind of dramatic and interesting," said Bill Montgomery, a former city parks director who is helping to organize the event in the city north of the Bay Area. Other efforts will be more artistic. In San Francisco, an artist at the Exploratorium science museum will use Jell-O to produce a sculpture of a shaking neighborhood. And a performer at the San Francisco Ballet will improvise a dance by acoordinating her movements to real-time seismic data transmitted on stage. Guests who sign up for a commemorative package deal at the city's Orchard Hotel will receive a 5:13 a.m. wakeup call, an emergency preparedness kit along with a copy of "1906," a new novel set in the aftermath. The cost: $190.60 a night, plus tax. San Francisco's restaurants and bars plan to promote mixed drinks with names such as Earthquake Cooler, Trembling Martini and the Quake and Fire cocktail — a mix of sparkling wine, orange juice and raspberry liqueur.
