NEWPORT, Pend Oreille County     Five engineers and seismologists from the Soviet Union, accompanied by two interpreters and U.S. military officials, have been inspecting a new seismic station near the Newport Geophysical Observatory     Before the United States tests a nuclear warhead underground in Nevada, Soviets will be brought to the Newport location and two others with equipment they will use to verify the size of the blast.     Newport was chosen as one of the three sites after President Bush and Soviet President Gorbachev signed a treaty last year, but this was the Soviets' first chance to inspect the station.
