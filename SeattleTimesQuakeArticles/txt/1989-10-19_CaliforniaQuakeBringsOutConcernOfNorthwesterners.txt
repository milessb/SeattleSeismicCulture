After all the flap about anti-California fever in Puget Sound, along comes a disaster like Tuesday's San Francisco Bay Area earthquake, and suddenly it's very clear: When a crisis hits there, people here are deeply affected        With the grim news Tuesday night, anxious Northwesterners tried desperately to get word of family and friends. Here are some of the stories they heard from those they reached:    Colleen and Seth Jackson of Mount Baker hadn't had time to start worrying when their son called from San Francisco to say he was safe. But as the TV told them the details, the precariousness of their son's position began to sink in.         Jordan Jackson, 30, was sitting alone in the bank where he worked, trying to guard computers and other valuables, prime targets for looters since the bank's windows had been blown out by the quake.          Colleen tried in vain to call back to tell him to abandon the bank before dark. Finally, at 8 p.m., Jordan called to say he was home.          His relieved parents were then in the perfect position to dispense parental advice to their son, who was without electricity.         ``Fill the bathtub,'' they told him, quoting the San Francisco newscasters they were hearing on their TV. ``Get out your phone book and find the diagram to cut off your gas. Don't go back to work until you hear it's safe.''    ``The only way we've gotten any information about family in San Francisco is through the mothers' network in Cleveland,'' Seattle resident Sue Sheckett said yesterday.         ``My brother, sister and all sorts of cousins are down there, but we can't get through to them. They're calling Cleveland where all the mothers are, so then we have to call Cleveland to hear anything.''         Three stories via the network:         --  The teen-age daughter of Sheckett's cousin, Milt Tennenbaum, was at choir practice when the quake hit. After an hour, only one parent had managed to reach the church to pick up his child. He loaded as many kids as he could into his car and spent the next eight hours driving back roads to get them home.         --  Sheckett's sister, Renee Shepherd, was working in her shop, Shepherd's Seeds, in Felton, outside of Santa Cruz. She may be selling a lot of ``mixed seed'' packets come spring.         --  Their brother, Donald Morgenstern of Santa Cruz, reported that in his relatively untouched suburban neighborhood, no one went to work, the weather was fine, and ``they were planning neighborhood barbecues for lunch and dinner because the power was out.''    Kathleen La Voy, a psychologist who specializes in coping with trauma, found it hard not to panic over her two sons in the Bay Area. ``I'm shaking right now.''         Oldest son Michael Johnson, 26, a medical resident, lives near the panhandle of Golden Gate Park. ``He and two people living in their apartment were bringing people off the streets, administering aid, calming people down.       ``For some reason people were able to get through to Seattle but not to other parts of the country, and he asked us to relay messages for some other people to their relatives.''        Michael was scheduled to work at Oakland General's emergency room yesterday, but ``he had no absolutely idea how he would get there. I tried to get him not to go. He said he couldn't do that, he had to try.''         La Voy hadn't heard from son Philip Johnson, 24, a Marine Ranger in Santa Cruz. A neighbor of his told her Philip was OK and out helping others.        La Voy is worried he'll get hurt: ``Phil's the kind who will jump into an ocean in a storm and bring someone off a rock.''    Helen Lee of Portland had a message on her answering machine from her husband, Harold, who was in San Francisco with daughter Terri and son-in-law Brian Cone for a water-pollution conference. He was OK, he said.       Later he called from a candlelit bar: he'd found Terri and Brian, safe.       The Cones' son, Chris, 8, back home, was hugely relieved. He'd happily sat down to watch the World Series - only to hear of the earthquake. ``He was immediately concerned. He said, `My folks are down there,' and he just didn't leave the TV set.''    Betty Anderson of Federal Way yesterday morning finally reached a sister in Portland, who had gotten through to their sister, Vanessa Gaddison. Vanessa, her husband Russell, and their 9-year-old twin boys live in Santa Clara.         ``Russell was on vacation. He was to visit his family in Oakland Tuesday night. He would have taken Interstate 880, the Nimitz Freeway. He decided to wait until after rush hour to make the trip.''    Mary Zabawa, assistant operations manager of the Seattle I. Magnin store, reached assistant buyer Monica Bakken at company headquarters in San Francisco.         ``No one could get out of the city,'' Zabawa said. ``About eight people from the offices went home with Mary and spent the night in her apartment on Russian Hill, which is not far from the offices, watching the fire.         ``They were able to find a store and stock up on food. There is lots of looting. Everyone was just glad to be alive.'
