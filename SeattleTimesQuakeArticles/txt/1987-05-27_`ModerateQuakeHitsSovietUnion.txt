MOSCOW _ An earthquake rocked the Soviet central Asian republic of Kirgizia yesterday, the official Tass news agency said today without mentioning damage or casualties.        Tass said the quake's epicenter was 25 to 30 miles northwest of Przhevalsk, some 90 miles west of the Chinese border.        It said the earthquake measured five, or ``moderately strong,'' on the 12-point Soviet scale.
