MEXICO CITY _ A $10 million ``Feel the Warmth of Mexico'' promotion drive has had mixed results in reviving Mexico's tourism industry after devastating earthquakes in September frightened foreign visitors off        The resorts of Cancun, Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta have been popular with winter-season visitors from the United States, Canada and, to a lesser extent, Europe. But in Mexico City, hardest hit by the earthquakes, the tourism picture has been disappointing.        Roberto Zapata, president of the Mexico City Hotel and Motel Association, was quoted in local newspapers as saying that forecasts of a winter pickup proved wrong and that the tourism industry lost some $400 million in Mexico City alone.        ``The winter season has been slow,'' said Aureliano Torres Izabal, manager of the 850-room Maria Isabel Sheraton Hotel at the edge of the Pink Zone tourist district. The occupany rate during the Christmas and New Year's holidays was 59 percent; 75 percent is normal.        He attributed the weakness to lingering concern about the earthquakes, the popularity of beach resorts and what he called the poor promotion by both private and government officials. The deterioration in the value of the peso currency, he said, has made advertising abroad costly.        The Tourism Department estimated that tourism was off 10 percent last year from 1984 when about 4.7 million tourists spent about $2 billion.        Projections for this year are that the number of tourists will remain at 4.7 million.        Many Americans had taken advantage of the U.S. dollar's strength to travel to Europe for good bargains. Since midsummer, however, the peso has tumbled sharply against the dollar, and tourists are finding their travel money going farther in Mexico.        Mexico City, with its wealth of museums, pre-Columbian ruins and tree-lined boulevards and parks, was hardest hit by the Sept. 19-20 earthquakes, which left more than 7,000 dead and an estimated 3,000 buildings destroyed or severely damaged.reopened half of its 300 rooms for the Christmas holidays. But he said tourism has still been slow in that resort.        Some hotels in Acapulco suffered minor cracks but that resort was virtually untouched by the tremors.        Other resort areas unaffected by the quake include Guadalajara, Puerto Vallarta, Cancun, Mazatlan, Manzanillo and Los Cabos.
