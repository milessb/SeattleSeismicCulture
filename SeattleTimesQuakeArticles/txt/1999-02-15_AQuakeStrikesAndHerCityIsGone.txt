MARTA MORALES feels safe in Bellingham, her adopted home. But she worries about the family she left behind in Pereira, Colombia. She was there last month when the city and her childhood home were suddenly reduced to rubble.     She grew up into a young woman there, in a valley among crooked mountains and coffee plants on humpbacked hills. She grew up, too, in the squalor of it all, in an awful poverty of dirt floors and cow-dung walls and dirty loaves of bread. Home. Pereira, Colombia. Letters on a map.   She hopes it still can be home - though the United States is where 27-year-old Marta Morales now lives - because  Pereira is where her soul was forged and because her mom and 18 brothers and sisters still live there, amid the clutter of shacks that have always looked like disaster.     Today, three weeks after a magnitude-6 earthquake struck and killed hundreds and injured thousands in her homeland, Pereira is, for all practical purposes, gone. Morales was there, roughhousing and playing with her nephews,  when it happened. Her house, three wobbly stories, crumbled into a tangle of rubble and tin.     "We did not think. We only watched," she says. "Then it was gone."      Morales is back now, in Bellingham, in her U.S. world of cell phones and Target stores and delivered pizzas. But something is different with her life that weighs on her. Her family still is in Colombia among the ruins of so many toppled homes. Morales has a comfortable place to sleep. Her dreams are not unburdened. `I wanted to go home'     Morales left Colombia 7 1/2 years ago, when one of her sisters, who had moved to the United States, matched her with a friend. Todd Moore of Bellingham flew to Colombia. They fell in love, got married and moved to the United States. She learned to speak English.    She had visited home several times since moving to the U.S., but, she says, those trips left her feeling empty because she and Moore stayed in hotels, spending little time with relatives. And as they walked the streets, Morales felt alien. The poor children squatting by the road probably thought she was monied. She feared she was a tourist to them, condescending in her interest in their desperate lives.     When Morales returned just before the quake, "I wanted to . . . sleep in my bed from when I was a kid.     "The other times it wasn't like I was going back home. I grew up very, very poor, and we had 20 people in one room. . . . We are a very close family. . . . I went back alone because I wanted to pay attention to my family. I wanted to go home. . . ." Snapshots of horror      The quake struck Jan. 25, about one week into the trip, early on a Monday afternoon. Her memory is scattered into snapshots of panic and the smell of fear.  It starts after the ground stopped shaking:      She stood among the rubble, choking on dust. She and her family had somehow escaped their crumbling house.     She was lost in thought, wondering. About God. Wondering when the last time anybody outside her sad old town had even uttered its name. Or if anybody else in the world would look beyond the news flash and bother to see what she was witnessing. The people of Pereira were not just devastated by an earthquake - worse, they had no chance against it.    The quake lasted half a minute. In her house, the concrete staircase cracked beneath her. Her aunt lay in bed, scared still, as chunks of concrete and metal fell from above.  "I was going from one wall to another wall. I was bouncing. I was carrying my brother's baby," Morales said later. She tried not to scream.     Somebody else's scream brought Morales back.  Near where she stood, a few people surveyed the scene, amazed they were alive, touching their own bodies in disbelief. The Earth's rumble seemed louder than anything Morales had ever heard. But the screams of wailing children, of young men and old women, were somehow worse, rare sounds that humans were not meant to make, or hear. City destroyed      Morales' aunt, who had to be carried outside,  could say very little. She was looking below, down the hill from their broken house, at what was known as downtown Pereira.     It was a bowl of dust, and the first of the survivors were scrambling from it. By the time it was over, officials figured that throughout central Columbia close to 1,000 died. Many would remain buried under landslides forever.              It was one of the worst earthquakes ever in the mountains of central Colombia, where quakes are not uncommon.  Deep under the Andes, the Earth shifts frequently. But experts said this quake was much closer to the surface - about 40 miles underground.     Morales lived through an earthquake when she was 7. She cannot remember details, but it saddened her later when she realized the city was simply too poor to start anew. Pereira looked as if disaster had struck, even when it hadn't - people had built upon their wreckage because that is all they could do.     "They don't know how to build houses for earthquakes. (Architects) don't build houses. The people . . . build houses that are weak." Rebuilding slowly       Morales is creating a history for herself in Bellingham.  She works as a cashier at an As Seen on TV store. She teaches kick-boxing and martial arts; she wants a stronger mind and thinks others should want that, too. She carries a cell phone to keep in touch with her husband. She is trying to call Bellingham home.     She sends back what money she can, saying it's her duty as family.  "A little bit of money can buy a lot. If I go there, I come back with nothing. I give them everything."      She has no plans to go back to Colombia. Airfare would be better spent, she says, on rebuilding her family's house or on food. Her family once tried to open a bakery, but it failed. Maybe they could try again.     Beyond that, she also is scared. Maybe of what she might find in Pereira - or worse, what she might not find. She fears the earthquake took more than lives, but also the soul of a place she loved, however dirty and poor.     When she sleeps now, in a safe bed, she wonders if Pereira has received some strange blessing, because the world paid attention when the earthquake hit, and that might mean the world will help fix it. But she wonders, too, if Pereira will remain simply letters on a map to other people.     It's always been that way, just another desperate place easily forgotten.
