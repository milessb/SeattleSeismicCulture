IN the aftermath of a disastrous earthquake such as that which struck Soviet Armenia this week, two questions tend to arise in many people's minds.         The first is humanitarian: What, if anything, can I do personally to help the unfortunate victims?         Those close to the relief effort say what's most needed now is money to help pay for rescue operations and medical care. Concerned Seattle-area citizens may send checks to the ``Armenian Relief Fund'' in care of the Armenian Cultural Association, 521 Pine St., Room 801, Seattle 98101.         The outpouring of help from around the world already has been heart-warming. President Reagan immediately pledged U.S. humanitarian aid. Britain dispatched London firefighters to join the rescue effort. Switzerland sent a team of search dogs to sniff for survivors. France offered a skilled rescue team that worked in the 1985 Mexico City relief operations.         But this will be the first time such a large amount of foreign aid has gone to the Soviet Union. That's thanks at least in part to Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost (openness) policy. In years past, the Soviets have been slow even to admit that disasters had occurred, much less to ask for outside help.         The next question that occurs to most people is: Is such devastation possible if a big earthquake hit where I live?         For most of the United States, including the Puget Sound region, the answer is: probably not. Although major earthquake faults exist along the West Coast, basic architecture and construction methods make most buildings fairly quake-resistant. Wood-frame buildings are far safer than stone, brick, and prefabricated concrete-slab construction, blamed for much of the death and injury in Armenia.         California's state geologist, who spent two years studying the complex seismology of Armenia, said a comparable quake in Los Angeles would kill no more than 1,000 people.         Still, many buildings in this country, including schools, do not meet earthquake-resistance standards. And most citizens do not know the most basic safety steps, such as standing in a doorway when the first shock is felt, and leaving buildings promptly before the inevitable aftershocks hit.         In any quake-prone area, complacency can be dangerous.
