MEXICO CITY _ Many buildings damaged by Mexico's two calamitous earthquakes last September are being repaired so poorly because of economic and political pressures that they might collapse if new tremors strike, experts say        The experts _ including engineers, architects, builders and diplomats _ claim that thousands of people living or working in these substandard buildings would be in danger during another quake. Anywhere from 7,000 to 20,000 people died in the Sept. 19-20 disasters, although the true death toll may never be known. At least 150,000 were left homeless.        How many structures might be affected by the shoddy workmanship could not be determined during recent interviews. But the experts cited specific examples of office buildings and housing complexes in Mexico City, and at least one luxury hotel in Ixtapa, 225 miles southwest of the capital on the Pacific coast.        What complicates the situation is that scores of other buildings which appear to be intact may have suffered hidden structural damage caused by stress during the quakes.        Another concern is that construction officials do not have a detailed study of Mexico City's subsoil, composed in part of an ancient lake bed. The subsoil changes constantly as water drains, and construction standards that appeared to be adequate when a building was put up may no longer be sufficient.        Douglas Loizeaux, vice president of Control Demolition, a Maryland-based company that has been inspecting and razing many of the buildings damaged in the quakes, was among the experts critical of the reconstruction.        Asked if buildings were being properly repaired, Loizeaux replied, ``Not according to the standards we are used to. They're using a lot of `anti-seismic paint.' If they have another large earthquake, there'll be real problems.''        Apparently many of the buildings that were damaged or fell in the most recent quakes were ones that had been poorly repaired following a big quake in 1957.        Economically strapped by a $96 billion foreign debt and plunging oil prices, Mexico's government has little money to demolish and rebuild many structures.        Meanwhile, at least 38,000 of those left homeless after the earthquakes still are living in temporary shelters or in tents pitched in parks and streets.        The combination of economic hard times and the housing shortage, sources said, has pressured the government and landlords to rush repairs and cut corners.
