The Port of Seattle has created a comprehensive earthquake-response plan that gives emergency powers to the Port's executive director in the event of such a disaster and sets the administrative headquarters at Pier 69 as the command center     David Schneidler of the Port's marine operations department called the plan a straightforward sequence of steps to be followed in the event of an earthquake disaster.     The plan also includes preparations to minimize the impact of a quake as well as policies and procedures to recover from earthquake damage at the Port and at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which the Port owns and operates.     Because the five-member Port Commission might not be immediately or continually available during a disaster, commissioners gave emergency powers to the Port's executive director during such a crisis, including authority to execute contracts and deploy Port resources.
