SEATTLE         The third earthquake in Western Washington in three days was felt by residents of Forks, on the west side of the Olympic Peninsula, Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University of Washington geophysics program said  yesterday        She said the quake, which measured 3.1 on the Richter scale, occurred at 10:40 p.m. Monday.        The temblor was centered two miles east of Forks and at a depth of 18 miles, she said.        There were no reports of damage.        Quakes were also felt in Western Washington Saturday and Sunday, with Saturday's registering 4.5 on the Richter scale, the biggest quake felt in the region in eight years.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in a local area and one of 4 can cause moderate damage.
