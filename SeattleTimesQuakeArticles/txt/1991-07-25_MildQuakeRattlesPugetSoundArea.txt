BREMERTON      Windows rattled around Puget Sound last evening when a mild earthquake, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale, rumbled from its epicenter eight miles south of Bremerton.      The quake was recorded at 6:46 p.m. at the University of Washington's geophysics center. The center first measured it at 3.6, but downgraded it after analyzing more data.      There were no reports of injuries or damage.
