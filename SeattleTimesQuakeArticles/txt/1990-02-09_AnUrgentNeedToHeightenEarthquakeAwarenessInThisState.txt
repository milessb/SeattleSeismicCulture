WASHINGTON state has experienced a number of major earthquakes since 1830. The 1949 magnitude 7.1 and 1965 magnitude 6.5 Puget-Sound-area quakes killed 15 people and caused more than $200 million (1984 valuation) in property damage         Numerous schools sustained major structural damage or partial collapse. Fortunately, few schoolchildren were present because of spring vacation.         These types of earthquakes will occur again. However, the occurrence of less frequent but significantly larger and more damaging quakes has gained wide acceptance in the scientific community.         These findings have led the U.S. Geological Survey and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to declare Washington state's residents to be the second-largest ``at risk'' population in the United States. California ranks first.         The National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) is a federally supported effort focused on reducing the loss of life and property. NEHRP provides funding for basic and applied geological and seismological research in the Pacific Northwest, as well as programs concerned with lifeline vulnerability, public policy, loss estimation, and emergency planning and response.         The Geological Survey has targeted additional resources for earthquake-hazard reduction in the Pacific Northwest. It is important that the federal initiative to fund mitigation programs continue, both nationwide and in Washington.         The consensus is that we are ill-prepared in a number of critical areas for the next damaging quake. These areas include safety in public schools; integrity of support facilities (such as power, water, transportation and communication); regional land-use planning, and emergency response.         Because of the new scientific findings, there is an urgent need to raise the level of awareness.         Public-school safety is a particular concern. A study published by the Geological Survey in 1975 discussing possible earthquake losses in a six-county area of Puget Sound - Snohomish, King, Pierce, Thurston, Mason and Kitsap - predicted that an earthquake during the school day would result in 63 to 69 fatalities in the schools.         Since 1975, there has been a major increase in population in the Puget Sound region. This trend will continue, putting still more people at risk.         Many school buildings in use in Washington were constructed prior to 1935. A 1983 study of the 233 school buildings in the Seattle School District showed that 33 percent of these buildings were constructed prior to 1935, and were mainly two- or three-story unreinforced-masonry (URM) structures, or two- and three-story frame schools on URM foundations and first stories.         URM construction poses the greatest risk of structural failure and collapse during an earthquake. In response to this study, the Seattle School District introduced a $64 million local bond issue to reconstruct or replace 16 of the pre-1935 school buildings considered to be the worst-case structures.         This bond issue was passed, and at this time ten new replacement schools have been or are being constructed, five buildings have been retrofitted to modern seismic-design standards, and a decision on the replacement or retrofitting of the remaining building will be made shortly.         Disruption and re-establishment of lifeline and business services are critical problems following a major quake. A number of actions are being taken to address risk to lifeline services. These include studies of vulnerability being conducted by private companies and public utilities. There are several initiatives before the Legislature to address these issues.         A state earthquake program is under way. Public-information brochures and guidelines for schools and hospitals have been distributed. A task force has been convened to evaluate the vulnerability of state agencies and propose steps to assure continuity of functions. NEHRP is funding a state study of geologic conditions in the Puget Sound region that may be particularly hazardous during an earthquake.         Actions not taken today on retrofitting buildings, strengthening lifelines, and requiring adequate land-use and construction practices will become cost-prohibitive in the future. Mitigation efforts taken now will reduce loss of life.         U.S. Sens. Brock Adams and Slade Gorton and Gov. Booth Gardner will hold a joint forum next Wednesday at the Westin Hotel in downtown Seattle. In addition, the Washington Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geology and Earth Resources, is sponsoring the fourth annual NEHRP workshop on earthquake hazards in the Puget Sound and Portland areas at the Seattle Sheraton Hotel on April 17-19.    Ray Lasmanis is manager of the Geology and Earth Resources Division, Washington State Department of Natural Resources. Steve Palmer is a geologist with the division.    Is Washington ready    for a big earthquake?    Conference when and where:    Wednesday, Feb. 14, Westin Hotel, Seattle    Featured speakers include:    Art Agnos, mayor of San Francisco    To register, please call:    Columbia Resource Group 441-644
