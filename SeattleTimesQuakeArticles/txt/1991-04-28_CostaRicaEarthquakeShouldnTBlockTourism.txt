Travelers need not cancel plans for trips to Costa Rica after the severe earthquake on Monday that was centered near the Caribbean port city of Limon, but they may have to modify their itineraries, according to tourism sources in the country      The main road east from the capital of San Jose - in the center of the country - to Limon was closed and two bridges were damaged, cutting off supply and relief routes.      At midweek, the government was saying it hoped to reopen the road within several days. Most electricity was said to have been restored to Limon by Wednesday, although water supplies were problematic.         Streets buckled and other minor damage was reported in San Jose, but contacts in the city said few services had been disrupted. The airport at San Jose received no major damage and is operating normally; the Limon airport was damaged but repairs reportedly have allowed return to some use.         Leda Munoz, a biologist who works as a guide for Horizontes Nature Adventures in San Jose, said she was in her apartment when the quake hit on Monday. (It registered 7.4 on the Richter scale of ground motion.)         She said a door in one room was ripped from its frame and lamps and other possessions were rocked to the floor. Strict building standards, based on Costa Rica's frequent earthquake activity, were said to have helped prevent widespread damage in the capital.         In Limon, however, and in surrounding rural areas east of the mountains that form a spine down the center of the Central American nation, structural damage has driven thousands from their homes.      At least 25 to 50 people have died in Costa Rica, at least 25 in Panama and a total of 700 injured.         The high season for tourism in Costa Rica is just ending; most organized tours from the U.S. conclude by the end of April, before spring rains move in and temperatures rise. Munoz said few reports of major damage had come from main tourism destinations in the western and central areas.         But travelers whose itineraries include time in the east and southeast - such as in La Amistad International Park orGuayabo National Monument - may find overland transportation difficult during the next few weeks.         Munoz and other guides said that travelers to areas hardest hit by the earthquake might consider bringing extra water, food or clothing if they can, to share with people they meet
