NEW DELHI, India--A strong earthquake rocked Pakistan and India today, knocking over buildings and houses, and killing at least 136 people, officials said. The U.S. Geological Survey reported on its Web site that the earthquake had a magnitude of 7.9 and was felt from Pakistan to Nepal, and in India, from New Delhi to Bombay and Madras in the south. Earlier the Indian Meteorological Institute had given a preliminary measurement of 6.9 for the quake with an epicenter in the Rann of Kutch, a desert plateau along the border between Pakistan and India. Rescuers pulled 18 bodies from the rubble of two collapsed buildings in the Indian city of Surat, 580 miles west of New Delhi, Assistant Commissioner of Police M.B. Tethani said by telephone from Surat. He said the death toll from the quake could climb as the rubble is cleared. In Hyderabad in Pakistan's Sindh region, emergency crews sifting through the wreckage of a fallen two-story house found the bodies of a child and an adult, and were searching for more victims. The quake, which struck at 8:50 a.m., was felt in Bombay, India's financial and entertainment capital, where residents fled tall buildings as pictures and cupboards shook. It was the same in Madras, on the eastern coast of India and in Pondicherry, further to the south, where officials with loudspeakers urged panicked residents to be calm. Millions of Hindu pilgrims sleeping in tents at India's Kumbh Mela festival in eastern Uttar  Pradesh, 930 miles east of Karachi, felt the ground sway beneath them, but there were no reports of panic. Residents of India's arid western states of Rajasthan and Gujarat rushed out of their homes, but then returned when the shaking stopped. The quake hit New Delhi, a city of 12 million people, just before India's massive Republic Day parade. No panic was reported at the parade site, which was to be attended by India's top government and military leaders.
