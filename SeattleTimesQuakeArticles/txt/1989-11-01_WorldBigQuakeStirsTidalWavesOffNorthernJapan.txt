TOKYO         A major earthquake measuring more than 7 on the Richter scale rocked Japan's main Honshu island early Thursday, prompting a tidal wave warning for the island's entire northern coast, officials said         U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) earthquake monitors in Golden, Colo., measured the earthquake at 7.3 on the Richter scale while Japanese geologists put it at 7.1.         Japan's Meteorological Agency issued a tidal wave warning for the entire northern coast of the island and predicted earthquake-induced waves, known as tsunami, would hit land by daybreak. Three-foot waves were recorded shortly after the quake struck.         Preliminary readings indicated the epicenter was about 45 miles off the northeast coast of Honshu, near the city of Miyako, population 61,912.

HOUSE APPROVES MINIMUM-WAGE BILL    WASHINGTON         The House today overwhelmingly approved legislation to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.25 by April 1991 and to establish a lower training wage for some teen-agers new to the job market.         The 382-37 vote came just a day after the White House and Democratic congressional leaders reached agreement on the plan, which would provide the first increase in the $3.35 minimum wage since 1981.         President Bush vetoed an earlier bill to raise the minimum wage to $4.55 an hour, and the House sustained the veto.         Senate leaders have promised to vote on the compromise soon in hopes of getting it to the White House for Bush's signature before Thanksgiving
