PASADENA, Calif. — The strong earthquake that hit California on Easter Day moved the location of the border city of Calexico. NASA data released Wednesday revealed the magnitude-7.2 quake shifted the Calexico region up to 2 1/2 feet in a southerly direction. The April 6 quake, centered in Baja California, caused $100 million in damage to the region, primarily in Calexico. It's not uncommon for massive quakes to move cities. After the magnitude-8.8 Chile quake this year, the city of Concepción rolled at least 10 feet to the west. Scientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory studied the shift using radar on a research aircraft.
