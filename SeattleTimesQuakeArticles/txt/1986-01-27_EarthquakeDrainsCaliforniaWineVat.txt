SAN JOSE, Calif. _ A rolling earthquake that measured an estimated 5.5 on the Richter scale jolted Northern California yesterday, toppling a 20,000-gallon redwood tank in San Benito County and leaving one of America's best-known wineries awash in an $800,000 sea of ruined cabernet sauvignon         The quake, centered southeast of Hollister, left one resident of that city with minor facial cuts from flying glass.         Except for a dented roof from a fallen tree, the loss of some valuable wine and a ruined tank at a century-old winery, the damage was reported as minor, authorities said.         No injuries or damages were reported elsewhere. The 11:20 a.m. quake rattled buildings as far north as San Francisco, south to San Luis Obispo and east to Fresno.         At the Almaden Vineyards' Cienega Winery, 11 miles south of Hollister, officials walked where a river of wine inundated rural Cienega Road and talked about good luck and bad.         The good luck was that, when the quake struck, no one was inside the 100-year-old tank building where wines are aged in 30-foot-high redwood barrels, made of 3-inch-thick redwood staves that hold back 80 tons of wine.         The bad luck was that the tank that was destroyed contained the winery's premium vintage, cabernet '85, destined first for the premier wine competitions of the United States and Europe and then to be marketed at $8 to $15 a bottle under Almaden's Charles LaFranc ``founder's wine'' label.
