BELLEVUE - The city may need to spend $4.4 million to upgrade city buildings to protect against major earthquake.     That's according to a seismic evaluation of several city buildings, including the police station, eight fire stations, community centers, as well as several buildings where people would be sheltered after an earthquake.     The report was conducted by Ratti, Swenson & Perbix, a Seattle engineering firm.     Paul Muldoon, Bellevue's facilities manager, said the investment would enhance the city's ability to provide emergency services after an earthquake.     The buildings are valued at $90 million, Muldoon noted.     Funding for the improvements, which would be made over the next four years, must be approved by the City Council.
