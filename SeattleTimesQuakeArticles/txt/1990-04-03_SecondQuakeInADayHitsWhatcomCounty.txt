BELLINGHAM         An earthquake rattled Whatcom County about 14 hours after another quake did minor damage in the Deming area.        The second quake, about 6:18 p.m. yesterday, registered about 4 on the Richter scale of ground motion, the University of Washington geophysics center reported.        The earlier quake, at 4:13 a.m. yesterday, measured 4.4 and knocked pictures off walls and bottles off store shelves in the area east of Bellingham.        An earthquake measuring 4 on the Richter scale has the potential of causing moderate damage.
