Rescue workers returning from the Philippines yesterday told stories of working under armed guard for protection from guerrillas and of searching for survivors - but finding only death.         The 22 volunteers spent 10 days in the Philippines helping after the July 16 earthquake, which killed 1,600 and left 88,000 homeless.         At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, the welcoming crowd of about 100 people, which included a dozen members of Seattle's Filipino community, carried balloons, flowers and bright banners. They clapped and cheered as the rescue workers, dressed in red hats and green jumpsuits, left the plane.         The rescue workers were all handshakes and smiles after the trip, and they chose to pause and discuss the mission instead of hurrying home.          The group, which lugged 4,300 pounds of equipment to a remote village north of Manila named Capintalan, set up camp near a a road ravaged by earthquake-related mudslides.         They spent their nights in sleeping bags and lived off spaghetti and granola bars brought from home and avocados and bananas provided by local people.         At all times they were accompanied by about 35 Philippine soldiers who were there to protect them from anti-U.S. rebels.          Part of the group set up a clinic. But only a handful of the 300 patients had been injured in the earthquake, said Anne Smith, a registered nurse who was greeted by her boyfriend, Craig Shivley, a surgery technician.         The doctors, nurses and paramedics devoted most of their attention to poor villagers who had had no treatment for such diseases as tuberculosis and dysentery until the volunteers arrived, Smith said.          ``The reception we got from the Filipino people was incredible,'' said Smith, arm-in-arm with Shivley. ``They really made us feel welcome.''           Other rescue workers scoured a 10-mile stretch of road for earthquake victims. Two dogs, trained in search and rescue, sniffed for people buried by mudslides.         ``Our main goal was to find people,'' said Kathi Gunn, a Portland nurse who searched for victims with her yellow Labrador retriever, Cody.         They found no survivors, she said, and at one point along the road the dogs found 55 bodies.         Richal Smith, a structural engineer, went along to check bridges for structural damage.         ``It was kind of scary sometimes,'' said Smith, adding that he worried more about possible rebel attacks than aftershocks. The rescuers encountered no insurgents, but they were frequently roused from sleep by tremors, he said.         After leaving the mud-caked village, the group met with Philippine President Corazon Aquino in Manila last Friday.         ``She was motherly,'' said Tammy Dunakin, a King County paramedic. ``She gave us all yellow coffee mugs that said, `I had coffee with Cory.' ''         The Seattle-King County Disaster team was organized in 1985 after members of local relief groups flew to Mexico City to assist earthquake victims there. Since then, members of the group have conducted rescue missions for three other earthquakes, most recently the October 1989 San Francisco quake.         Several rescue workers said they found working with people in the Philippines the most rewarding part of the trip.         ``One morning I woke up, and there were villagers on my left and soldiers protecting us from the rebels on my right. We were a unified group all working for one thing,'' Gunn said. ``This was my first disaster, but I would go again.'Caption:  PHOTOBARRY WONG / SEATTLE TIMES: LEONILA MABANSAG, LEFT, WAS AT SEATTLE-TACOMA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT YESTERDAY TO THANK BARBARA STILLWATER AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SEATTLE-KING COUNTY DISASTER TEAM AS THEY RETURNED FROMTHE PHILIPPINES.
