SALEM, Ore. - Many more homeowners have earthquake insurance today than seven years ago, when the "Spring Break Quake" jolted Oregonians into getting more coverage, a trade group says.     About 30 percent of homeowners now have earthquake coverage, compared with just 3 percent when a 5.6-magnitude quake shook northwestern Oregon on March 25, 1993, according to Insurance Information Services of Oregon & Idaho.     The temblor cracked the state Capitol rotunda and caused $30 million in damage, but caused no deaths or serious injuries.     Most of the day's business had not begun when the 5:30 a.m. quake hit. Luckily, schools weren't in session; some brick buildings, including schoolhouses, had major damage.     Krista Fischer, executive director of Insurance Information Services of Oregon and Idaho, said 2 to 3 percent of Oregon homeowners used to add earthquake coverage after a quake in California, and would drop it the next year.     "Having an earthquake of noticeable magnitude in Oregon made the difference in the number of Oregonians who added the coverage and kept it," she said.     Most insurers have raised their minimum deductibles since 1993, however, from 5 percent to 15 percent of the covered value.     Earthquake coverage for wood-frame houses averages 23 cents to 85 cents per $1,000 worth of insurance, with top prices in higher-risk zones.     That translates to $23 to $85 a year for a $100,000 home.     For masonry houses, prices  average from $1.65 to $2.80 per $1,000 of coverage.     Experts say Oregon is due for a huge quake, probably of 8 or 9 magnitude.     Dennis Olmstead, deputy state geologist, said the agency has received federal funds to further study the Mount Angel Fault, source of the 1993 quake centered near the town of Scotts Mills, northeast of Salem.
