INCIRLIK, Turkey - The deadly earthquake in Turkey over the weekend caused minor damage to a U.S.-Turkish air base from which Western jets patrol northern Iraq, U.S. Air Force officials said today.     "We have one or two buildings that will probably be structurally unsound," said Capt. Max Torrance.    The magnitude 6.3 earthquake on Saturday struck the city of Adana, near the air base at Incirlik.     Sources said there had been no change in the routine of the flights, which are intended to keep President Saddam Hussein's forces out of Kurdish northern Iraq.     Officials at a crisis center in the capital Ankara said today the death toll from the quake had risen to 127 as rescue workers pulled more bodies from the rubble.     Paramedics yesterday carried a 46-year-old woman alive from under a collapsed building in the town of Ceyhan, 48 hours after the quake.     Hundreds of villagers in Yakapinar spent their third night outdoors, fearing their badly damaged homes could collapse.     The villagers said they were Kurds who had fled fighting between troops and separatist rebels in southeast Turkey in the early 1990s and built makeshift homes that were easily damaged by the quake.     "We sleep outdoors, we cook outdoors, we eat outdoors, What else can we do?" said Adule Elmas, a woman washing pots on the ground.    "Nobody is helping us. We are very anxious. Nobody is telling us when the aftershocks will stop," said Sahin Sever, who is sleeping under a nylon sheet in his family's melon field near Ceyhan.    Emine Bitirgec was waiting for news on three missing relatives.    "When I close my eyes, I see the little, beautiful faces of Sinem and Gizem," she said, referring to nieces. "Maybe they are still alive. Maybe they found a place to hide."Caption:  PHOTOBURHAN OZBILICI / AP: TEN-YEAR-OLD HAYRULLAH EROGLU LIES IN A TENT SET UP FOR INJURED EARTHQUAKE SURVIVORS IN THE GARDENS OF A HOSPITAL IN ADANA, TURKEY.
