An earthquake measuring 7.7 on the open-ended Richter scale rocked the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East today, prompting officials to warn of a possible  tsunami off Alaska. The warning was later canceled     A Japan Meteorological Agency spokesman said there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the earthquake, which happened around 3:30 a.m. PST.    The quake was centered 75 miles off the Kamchatka Peninsula, said Paul Whitmore of the Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska.    The center issued a tsunami warning for coastal Alaska from Dutch Harbor to Attu in the Aleutian Islands. But after observations at Attu and Shemya, east of Attu, the warning was canceled.     Also in the Kamchatka area, the Bezymyanny volcano, one of its most active volcanoes, began erupting today for the second time this year, spewing ashes into the sky, Russia'sEmergencies Ministry said.     The 9,412-foot-high volcano started erupting after the seismic activity in the Bering Sea and sent ashes 5 miles high, ministry officials said.    American satellites showed a 60-mile-long trailing cloud of ashes from the volcano, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.    American airliners were informed of the eruption and changed course accordingly, the news agency said, citing an unidentified spokesman for a Russian-U.S. scientific group that monitors potential danger for flights.    Flights between Russia and Alaska pass over Kamchatka.    The eruption posed no immediate threat to the nearest communities - Kozyrevsk, 20 miles from the volcano, and Klyuchi, 30 miles away, the Interfax news service reported.    The Kamchatka Peninsula, eight time zones east of Moscow, has 29 active volcanoes. Eight have erupted repeatedly in the last decade.
