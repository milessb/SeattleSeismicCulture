An earthquake early today shook an area near Bellingham, but there were no reports of damage or injuries.        The quake, which registered 2.6 on the Richter Scale, was near Deming, an area that has had several small quakes in the past year, according to the geophysics department at the University of Washington.        The quake hit at 6:33 a.m. 4 miles east-southeast of Bellingham, said Ruth Ludwin at the UW.        ``There was a loud bang and some shaking, but that's all,'' according to a spokeswoman for the Emergency Management Department of the Whatcom County sheriff's office.
