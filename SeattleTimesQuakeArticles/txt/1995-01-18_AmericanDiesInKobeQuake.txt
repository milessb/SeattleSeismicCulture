KOBE - A teacher from Southern California was among the victims of the earthquake in Japan, her family said.     Voni Lynn Wong, 24, died when her home in Ashiya collapsed during the earthquake.    Wong was the first American fatality reported, State Department spokeswoman Julie Restide told the Los Angeles Daily News.    Wong went to Japan to teach English after graduating from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1993. She left Los Angeles for Japan last year just 12 days before L.A.'s deadly Northridge earthquake, her family said.    Kobe, the Japanese city hardest hit by the quake, has a substantial foreign community. The U.S. Embassy said there are believed to be 8,000 to 10,000 Americans in and around Kobe and Osaka, Japan's second-largest city. The quake zone is 280 miles west of TokyoCaption:  PHOTOVONI LYNN WONG
