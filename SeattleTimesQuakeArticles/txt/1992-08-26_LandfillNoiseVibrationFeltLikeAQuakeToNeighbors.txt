CLEARVIEW - Barb Liggett thought the Big One had finally hit. But there was something wrong with this "earthquake." It started like a tremor and kept going, but never grew in intensity.     "It was so obvious that something bizarre was happening," said Liggett, recalling the ground vibrations that shook her house for nearly two hours more than a week ago.     "It was like a huge truck idling right outside the house. You didn't feel wind, but something was pounding on your body. There was no way you could sleep."      There were many others who also felt the vibrations and inundated Snohomish County 911 lines and area fire departments with calls.     The culprit wasn't Mother Nature, however. At fault was a broken tube connector at the Cathcart landfill that turned a methane burner into a giant pipe organ that sounded like a sound check for a heavy-metal band.     "There was no damage and no potential for a big explosion at all," said Ken Moser, a senior project adviser for Snohomish County's solid-waste division.           While Cathcart officials said a repeat performance is not likely, residents want assurances that the irritating serenade and vibration will end.      Liggett, who lives south of the landfill, said it has happened more than once. The greatest intensity was felt on Aug. 14, when the vibrations lasted for nearly two hours. But Moser maintains the problem occurred only once.     "I heard about the problem, but I am not satisfied," Liggett said of Moser's explanation. "The house was shaking. . . . It was like an earthquake."      Rick Eastman, chief for Snohomish County Fire District 7, which covers the area between Mill Creek and Monroe, confirmed that his department received several calls related to the noise. On Aug. 14, firefighters offered their station as a refuge for some residents who were too scared to sleep at home.     "There was some concern it felt like an earthquake," Eastman said.     Nancy Waddell, spokeswoman for the solid-waste division, said residents will receive a letter within the next week explaining what caused the vibrations. Emergency services such as District 7 also will be contacted by the waste division.     According to Moser, several things led to the noise and vibration.     The Cathcart landfill, which closed on June 27, produces large amounts of methane from decomposing waste. A series of pipes throughout the landfill collects the methane, which is pulled into burners by large fans.    Flames from the burning methane come out of stacks 20 feet tall and 5 feet across. The pipes above ground are temporary and have been moved several times as workers gradually cap the landfill.     Moser said extreme weather changes from hot days to cool nights most likely led to a break in a connection that held two pipes together. The suction from the fans started pulling air through the break into the closed system, lowering the temperature in the burners.     The oxygen reduced combustion, creating a flashback in the stacks, Moser said. It was a like a car backfiring, sending the noise and vibration into the ground.     "There was barely enough methane to keep the flames going," he said.     Moser said several steps have been taken to prevent this happening again.     An automatic shutoff that stops the methane fire after sensing a drop in temperature has been calibrated to make it more sensitive, and workers inspect the pipes daily. In November, when capping is completed, the above-ground pipes will be welded together.     Liggett hopes it all works. The last thing she wants to do is spend a night at the fire station.Caption:  PHOTOTERI HARRIS / SEATTLE TIMES: SURVEYOR TOM VANDER WALL, OF HARMSEN & ASSOC.
