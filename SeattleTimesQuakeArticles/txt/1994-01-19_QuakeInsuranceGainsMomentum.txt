The Southern California earthquake early Monday sparked new interest in homeowner earthquake insurance here, just  like what happened after the 1989 San Francisco quake and the discovery of a Seattle fault line in 1992    "We got about 300 calls Monday and probably the same today (Tuesday)," said Terry Sager, a Pemco Insurance agent. Other agents reported similar volumes.     The earthquake  also added momentum in the state insurance commissioner's office to drafting a bill that would require insurance companies to offer earthquake insurance. Not all do now.     "Our bill also will address the cost," said Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn.   She said some insurance companies can't afford to offer the coverage, and if they do, consumers have trouble paying for it.   Senn said standard premiums in Western Washington range up to about $1.50 a year per $1,000 of value for frame homes and to nearly $9 per $1,000 for masonry or brick homes, which are more vulnerable.   "It's very important that we start preparing for a quake here," Senn said.    Most standard  homeowner policies don't cover structural damage from earthquakes.     "If a water heater goes over and there is water damage, that would be covered by a homeowners' policy," said Jeff Ogard, a Safeco  underwriting manager. "Or if there is fire damage caused by broken gas lines. But not structural damage."      Even with earthquake insurance, deductibles and exceptions push a lot of the replacement cost of a structurally damaged home onto its owners.     Insurance officials estimated property damage in Southern California would total more than the $7 billion record set in the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, and they said most of it is uninsured. In the San Francisco quake, only $960 million in losses were insured, said the Insurance Information Institute.     The situation in the Puget Sound area would be comparable, said insurance officials.     Seven to 12 percent of Washington's residents are believed to be covered by specific earthquake-insurance policies, Senn said.     Safeco Corp., a large Seattle-based insurer, said only 10.5 percent of the 187,000 home policies it underwrites here have the extra coverage. It carries the special policies on 4,900 mobile homes, for 811 condominium owners and for 760 renters in Washington.     Safeco's special quake insurance would cost the owner of a $200,000 home about $300 a year in premiums above a standard homeowner's coverage, with higher premiums for homes faced with brick or stone.  The insurance includes a 5 percent deductible on the structure and on personal property within it.     Pemco Insurance Co., a Seattle-based insurer that handles only policies for Washington properties, said it charges 96 cents per $1,000 value ($96 per $100,000) for wood homes and more for those built of brick or stone.     In Los Angeles, earthquake policies add $400 a year to the average homeowner-insurance bill. About  40 percent of Los Angeles-area homeowners buy the special policies, said Jim Snyder, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California.
