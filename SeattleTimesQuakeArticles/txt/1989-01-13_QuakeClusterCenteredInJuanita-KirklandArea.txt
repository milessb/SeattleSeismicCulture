A swarm of 10 small earthquakes last night was centered in the Kirkland-Juanita area, say University of Washington seismologists.         Only three of the 10 shakes were strong enough to be felt by anyone, said Chris Jonientz-Trisler, research scientist at the UW seismology laboratory.         The two strongest quakes, between 10:33 p.m. and 10:39 p.m., were recorded at 2.2 on the Richter scale. The third was slightly weaker, she said.         Two of the other seven events were so small their locations were not recorded by the seismology equipment, Jonientz-Trisler said. All 10 came from an area that has generated a number of very small quakes in recent months, she said.         No injuries or damage was reported.         The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
