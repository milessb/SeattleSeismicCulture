PORTLAND, Ore. - The Metropolitan Service District and the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries are cooperating on a pilot project to determine how prepared the Portland area is for an earthquake. The project will establish a data bank that would be useful in the event of an earthquake. Information will be accessible to local governments, emergency response personnel, businesses and utility companies.    The agencies will identify earthquake hazard zones, existing fault lines and unstable ground that would be likely to give way during an earthquake. They also will classify the type and architecture of buildings in the area.
