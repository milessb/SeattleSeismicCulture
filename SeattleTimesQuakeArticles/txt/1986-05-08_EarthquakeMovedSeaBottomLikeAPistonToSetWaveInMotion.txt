When a huge section of the North Pacific Ocean bottom jumped violently yesterday afternoon, it sloshed the water around much as would happen if the bottom suddenly fell out of a bathtub.         The result was a powerful ocean wave, or tsunami, that began spreading in all directions from the center of the earthquake, 100 miles southeast of Adak Island in the Aleutians. The wave reached Adak in less than an hour, causing a sudden rise in water level of about 5.8 feet.         But the wave could have been much worse. The quake, 7.7 on the Richter scale, triggered tsunami warnings all around the North Pacific rim. Such waves in the past have killed people and devastated waterfronts thousands of miles from the earthquake.         Yesterday's tsunami was somewhat of a fizzle. But it had potential for disaster.         On March 17, 1964, a tsunami that followed an earthquake measuring 8.5 on the Richter scale struck the north shore of Prince William Sound, Alaska. That wave claimed 114 lives in Alaska and five lives in Oregon and caused millions of dollars in damage all the way to Crescent City, Calif., where the entire waterfront business district was hit.         Walter Hays of the U.S. Geological Survey said the severity of a tsunami depends on the amount of vertical movement of the ocean bottom, the suddenness of the movement and the contour of the surrounding ocean bottom.         ``In a big earthquake, the vertical motion of the ocean bottom acts like a piston to set the tsunami process in motion,'' Hays said. ``And the efficiency of the tsunami-generating mechanism can be diminished if the surrounding ocean bottom is very irregular.''         In deep water, the wave doesn't look like much, perhaps a foot high with as much as 60 miles between wave crests. Most of the wave's structure is below the surface. Waves can travel at 400 to 600 miles an hour in the open sea.         But when a tsunami gets into shallow water, the bottom forces the structure of the wave up higher, and the speed of the wave drops.         Hays explained that the great distance between crests of a tsunami prevents it from cresting and breaking as storm waves do in surf. Instead, shallow water forces the wave crests up as much as 80 feet. The result is a sudden, sometimes catastrophic, rise in water level along shorelines.         A spokesman for the National Earthquake Information Service near Denver said it would take days to collect enough data to calculate the vertical movement in yesterday's quake. But it apparently was enough to trigger the tsunami alert.
