KLAMATH FALLS, Ore. - An earthquake registering a magnitude of 3.4 rattled the Klamath Falls area Sunday night.      It was felt from Klamath Falls to Medford, but no damage or injuries were reported.    The epicenter was in almost the same place as a series of quakes that struck six years ago, killing two people.   The epicenter was 13.9 miles west-northwest of Klamath Falls.    In 1993, the tremor measured at magnitude 3.9. Two larger quakes, magnitude 5.9 and 6.0, occurred within a few hours, followed by hundreds of aftershocks over the ensuing months.
