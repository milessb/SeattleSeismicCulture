DUVALL     An earthquake of 3.1 magnitude shook North King County yesterday in the same area where a larger quake struck last year.    The quake occurred at 4:06 p.m. and was centered five miles northeast of Duvall, said Bill Steele, coordinator of the University of Washington Seismology Laboratory. Ten people called the lab to say they felt the quake.        Duvall residents reported feeling nothing at all to a quick vibration. There were no reports of injuries.    Former City Councilwoman Kass Holdeman was at home quilting when she felt the ground move. "I felt it through the floor. It just shook for three seconds," she said. "It was like a big truck driving by."      But Duvall Mayor pro tem Pat Fullmer said she didn't feel a thing.     In nearby Carnation, residents also reported feeling the earth shake.     A 5.3-magnitude quake struck the Duvall area May 2, 1996.
