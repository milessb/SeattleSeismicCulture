Thursday's drill was based on a fictional magnitude-7.8 event on the southern San Andreas fault. If such a quake occurred today, scientists estimate it would kill 1,800 people and cause $200 billion in damage. The dress rehearsal served to remind Californians that they live on shaky ground.Caption:  photoDamian Dovarganes / The Associated Press : Teacher Tarra Chase, right, evaluates vital signs of students Savanah Purnell, left, Ellis Blanton and Ella Fessenden, who pretended to be injured during Southern California's earthquake drill at the Altadena Christian Children's Center in California.
