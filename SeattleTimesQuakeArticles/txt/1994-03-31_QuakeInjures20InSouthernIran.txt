NICOSIA, Cyprus - An earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale injured at least 20 people today in an area of southern Iran that has been hit by some 200 tremors and aftershocks this month, Iran's IRNA news agency said     The quake struck Firuzabad, 470 miles south of Tehran, and nearby villages soon after midnight, IRNA said.     Many panic-stricken people in the region, where a slightly stronger earthquake killed six people and badly damaged some 3,000 houses on March 1, spent the rest of the night in the streets and fields, IRNA said.     Relief teams and food, tents and other emergency supplies were sent to the area, a main center of Iran's biggest semi-nomadic tribe, the Qashqaei.
