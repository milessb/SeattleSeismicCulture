It may look a little like an old Laurel and Hardy movie: A guy hits the ground with a sledgehammer. His partner may fire a shotgun into the dirt. Then they get out a jackhammer-like device and start thumping away         And sometimes they hover over their listening instruments when there apparently is nothing to hear.         These, ah, interesting activities began in Seattle parks yesterday and will continue into next week. But, despite appearances, it's serious work by the U.S. Geological Survey, aimed at learning more about how Seattle soils will respond to an earthquake. The State Department of Natural Resources is cooperating in the study, which will continue in Tacoma and Olympia.         ``We think the structure of the upper 200 feet of ground surface is what determines which areas get the most damage from earthquakes,'' said Kenneth King of the Survey's Golden, Colo., office. ``Below that, it doesn't seem to make much difference.''         The work is part of a five-year program to improve estimates of urban earthquake hazards. Similar studies have been completed in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City.         The study involves making a big enough whump to cause a vibration in the ground, a tiny imitation of the violence of an earthquake. Instruments arrayed hundreds of feet from the vibration-maker will detect the ground-surface response.         In addition, King and his partner, Arthur Tarr, will use a signal from a more distant source _ vibration from coal-mining blasts near the Centralia power plant that occur about 2 p.m. on most weekdays.         Vibration from the blasts bounces between ground layers as it rumbles from the Centralia mine, about 65 miles southwest of Seattle. Instruments arrayed in various areas of Seattle detect the vibration _ too tiny to be felt by humans _ at roughly the same time. Analysis gives clues as to how the ground surface would react to an earthquake.         It is important to know whether the soil lying on top of bedrock amplifies or damps the shaking of the bedrock in an earthquake. King and Tarr will have an instrument mounted in a place where bedrock is exposed, such as at Seattle's Seward Park. Signals received there can be compared with those at places where soil is hundreds of feet deep over bedrock.         The Salt Lake City study turned up one tentative result where the shaking on the surface was 10 times that in the bedrock. In Seattle, the geologists will use information from past earthquakes in placing instruments.         ``There isn't too much about an earthquake that is lucky,'' King said, ``but we do feel lucky to know the damage patterns in Seattle from the 1949 and 1965 earthquakes.''         King and Tarr did preliminary work in Seattle last December, when they picked up vibration from an underground nuclear blast in Nevada. They also performed a test that must have looked even stranger than their ground-thumping activities of this week. Here was the scene in an otherwise dignified West Seattle neighborhood:         Two men were leaning against a house, pushing against it in time to the shouts of a third man perched near an instrument on the roof. A cable from the instrument trailed down the side of the house to a van parked at the curb.         The instruments detected tiny horizontal vibrations of the house produced by the rhythmic pushing. King explained that analysis of the results showed how that house would respond to horizontal ground shaking in an earthquake.         SEISMIC TESTS PLANNED IN PARKS    Here is a tentative schedule for seismic tests in Seattle's parks. The schedule is subject to change due to weather or test-equipment problems.    Today: Jefferson Golf Course.    Tomorrow: Jefferson and Genesee parks.    Wednesday: Alki Beach, Hiawatha Community Center, Schmitz Park.    Thursday: West Seattle Golf Course and Puget Sound, Lincoln and Westcrest parks.    Friday: Brighton Park.    Saturday: City Hall Park.    Next Monday: Washington Park ArboretumCaption:  PHOTOGREGORY SCOTT / SEATTLE TIMES: DEAN YANNACITO OF THE U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY TESTS THE GROUND AT MYRTLE EDWARDS PARK IN SEATTLE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.
