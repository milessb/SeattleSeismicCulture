HOMER, Alaska     A moderate earthquake shook residents early this morning, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center reported.    The quake struck at 3:21 a.m. Alaska Standard Time and was centered about 50 miles west of Homer.     It measured 5.3 on the Richter scale. No damage or injuries were reported in Homer, which is about 100 miles south of Anchorage on the Kenai Peninsula.    The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.    An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in a local area, 4 can cause moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, and 6 can be severe. A 7 reading is a "major" quake, capable of widespread heavy damage, and 8 is a "great" quake, capable of tremendous damage.    The 1964 Alaska quake that killed 131 people measured 8.4 on the Richter scale, while the San Francisco quake of 1906 was estimated to register 8.3.
