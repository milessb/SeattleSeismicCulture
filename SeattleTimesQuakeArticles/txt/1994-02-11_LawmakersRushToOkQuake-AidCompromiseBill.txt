A costly package of Los Angeles earthquake aid, financed largely by deficit spending, is  on a fast track for compromise talks between the House and Senate as lawmakers  pushed to complete work on the bill today    After two days of debate that centered largely on deficit concerns, the Senate approved $8.6 billion in grants and loans last night for victims of the deadly Jan. 17 quake. The vote was 85-10.    The House passed its bill last week, and lawmakers for the two houses were meeting today to try to work out differences in time to accommodate members of Congress eager to begin a 10-day midwinter break.    Both houses rejected calls for deeper cuts to keep the deficit from rising as the earthquake aid was spent. Independent-counsel law gets OK  The House voted 356-56 yesterday to renew the expired law that lets a court-appointed independent counsel conduct criminal investigations of high government officials.     Democrats beat back a Republican attempt to have all criminal investigations of members of Congress handled by the neutral prosecutor. Instead the House backed a Democratic substitute, supported by the Clinton administration, that would give the attorney general discretion to have the Justice Department conduct the probe of a lawmaker or apply for an independent counsel.
