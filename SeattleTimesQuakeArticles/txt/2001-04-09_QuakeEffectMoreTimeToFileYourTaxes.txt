If you live in the Nisqually earthquake disaster area you have until April 30 to file your federal income-tax return by marking in big red letters "Washington State Earthquake" on the top margin of the return form. If another two weeks still won't give you enough time to get your taxes together, you have the option of delaying filing until Aug. 15. By filing Form 4868--which can be found on Page D 2 of this paper--by April 16, you can get an automatic four-month extension. This longer extension, however, does not give you more time to pay any taxes due. You will owe interest on any amount not paid by April 16, plus a late-payment penalty if you have not paid at least 90 percent of your total tax by that date. You can call (toll-free) 1-888-796-1074, e-file a Form 4868 that is in most tax-preparation software, or send a paper Form 4868 to the IRS. You will need the Adjusted Gross Income and Total Tax amounts from your 1999 return if you request the extension by computer or phone. You may also get an extension by charging your expected balance on a credit card, and you won't have to file the form.
