CORVALLIS, Ore. - Oregon State University scientists have found a major fault in the ocean floor 70 miles off Pacific City that is similar to the San Andreas fault that touched off the Bay Area quake         The find reinforces the possibility that Oregon could be due for an earthquake, but scientists don't know whether the fault could cause one, said LaVern Kulm, an OSU professor of oceanography.         ``We're just beginning the research,'' he said.         However, in 1973, an earthquake measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale occurred near the fault, he said.         Researchers have measured 10 miles of the fault at a depth of two miles. Bob Yeats, a geology professor working with Kulm, said it may be a segment of a fault extending from Northern California to north of Puget Sound.         ``It is a very striking feature,'' Kulm said. ``This is the largest fault we've seen off the Northwest coast.''         The Pacific City fault is not physically linked to the San Andreas fault, which stretches for hundreds of miles in California. But both are strike-slip displacements. That means each side of the fault has slipped in opposite directions. Kulm said the Pacific City fault appears to have moved 500 to 650 feet during 20,000 years.         The fault intersects the Cascadia subduction zone, where one of the Earth's massive crustal plates slides under the Continental Shelf. Subduction zones are principal locations of earthquakes.         OSU scientists mapped the fault in detail last August.         ``We could tell on the ship right away that it was there,'' Kulm said. It took several months to refine the image, he said.         In 1986, using less-sophisticated sonar, OSU scientists discovered the fault in a joint study with scientists of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But they did not know its size or significance until they mapped it in August.         Kulm said they mapped the fault with an underwater instrument known as a sidescan sonar, which they were using to make images of the ocean floor off Tillamook and Lincoln counties. A sidescan sonar sends pulses of sound downward on an angle to the ocean floor.         Near the fault's midpoint, scientists discovered an 820-foot mud volcano. The volcano arose when watery muds trapped under the ocean floor escaped through the crack. Hot water seeps from the fault, providing a bed for deep-sea clams, Yeats said.
