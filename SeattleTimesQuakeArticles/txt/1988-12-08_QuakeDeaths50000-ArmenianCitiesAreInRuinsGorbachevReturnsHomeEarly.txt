An earthquake in Armenia that may have killed up to 50,000 people prompted Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to cut short his visit to the United States today to help cope with ``extremely grave consequences, devastation and great loss of life.'         Armenian journalists said a Politburo commission was receiving preliminary estimates that up to 50,000 people died in the quake, which struck yesterday.         Soviet officials reported thousands dead but provided no detailed casualty count. In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said he had no information to back up the figure of 50,000.         And in London, George Kurkjian, a representative of the Patriarch of the Armenian Apostolic Church of South Armenia, quoted church sources in Moscow as saying the death toll could reach 100,000.         In a departure statement at New York's chilly Kennedy International Airport, Gorbachev said he had received condolences and offers of relief assistance from President Reagan and President-elect George Bush.         Reagan, who held his fifth and last summit with the Kremlin leader yesterday, telephoned Gorbachev from Washington this morning.         ``If there is any way in which we can be of assistance, either bilaterally or through the international community, please let me know,'' Reagan told Gorbachev.         Said Gorbachev upon his departure: ``I would like to thank them and thank the American people for those feelings and for their readiness to give assistance in this difficult hour.''         Appearing grim as he addressed reporters, Gorbachev said through a translator: ``I have to cut short this visit because late last night it was reported to me that the earthquake . . . was extremely severe and had extremely grave consequences, devastation and loss of life.''         Gorbachev originally had planned a day of sightseeing before leaving New York for Cuba and England. Great Britain flew rescue workers and special equipment to Armenia today, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher offered more help.         The earthquake leveled cities and killed thousands of people, including at least 50 children buried by rubble when their school collapsed, officials said today.         ``More than 50 little corpses of schoolchildren have been taken from the ruins,'' the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper said today of the Soviet quake. ``Some children, amazingly, survived.''         Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told a news conference in New York that Soviet monitors registered the temblor at 8 on the Richter scale. Measurements by the U.S. Geological Survey, however, put the magnitude at 6.9.         The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. A magnitude 8 quake is capable of tremendous damage. The Mexico City earthquake in 1985, which measured 8.1, killed at least 4,200 people.         The Soviet quake was centered south of the Caucasus Mountains in Soviet Central Asia, near Leninakan and between the Georgian capital of Tbilisi and the Armenian capital of Yerevan, said the official news agency Tass. Each capital has a population of about 1 million.         The government rushed soldiers and civilian volunteers to the disaster area, which encompassed most of northwestern Armenia.         Soviet officials set up a ``helicopter bridge'' to take victims from the mountainous republic of 3.3 million people to neighboring Soviet Georgia. Official Soviet media said the earthquake wiped out villages and destroyed half of Kirovakan, a city of 170,000 people.         The temblor was felt as far away as Tabriz, in northwestern Iran, 250 miles southeast of Tbilisi.         The 16,000-resident town of Spitak, near the epicenter of yesterday's quake, reportedly was wiped out. The government newspaper Izvestia said just one of the town's eight schools still stood.         The quake struck in midmorning, when schools were in session and factories were operating.         State television showed film of crumbled buildings in Kirovakan and in Spitak. In one shot, a man put his hands over his head in grief as he stood amid a collapsed building.         Other footage showed people searching through the rubble. Huge columns of concrete and steel were twisted and broken like matchsticks by the powerful quake.         People wandered stunned through city streets, many gathering around campfires. Dazed people were seen walking around piles of rubble.         ``Practically all apartment buildings of nine floors or higher are destroyed,'' Komsomolskaya Pravda said.         Army Gen. V.M. Arkhipov told Tass that soldiers were setting up tent cities today for evacuees.         Komsomolskaya Pravda reported from Leninakan that preliminary reports indicated ``tens of thousands of people became victims of the earthquake.''         Albert Khachatryan of the Armenian Ministry of Health said that 2,000 injured people had been brought to Yerevan from Leninakan, Kirovakan and Spitak, and more were expected.         Nora Milikyan, an editor of the official Armenian news agency Armenpress, said in a telephone interview from Yerevan that ``all the injured are being brought to Yerevan. The hospitals are completely full.         ``The worst place was Spitak. The entire town was destroyed - the hospitals and the schools and the factories. All the houses were destroyed. There is nothing left there,'' she said.         Komsomolskaya Pravda said soldiers working under spotlights pulled the bodies of the more than 50 children from a school in Leninakan during the night.         Gennady Gerasimov, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in New York: ``A small village has practically disappeared from the face of the earth.'' He did not identify it.         A commission of the ruling Communist Party Politburo, led by Premier Nikolai  Ryzhkov, arrived in Yerevan this morning to supervise rescue operations.         Komsomolskaya Pravda said dozens of surgeons were on their way to the city to help with the injured.         The newspaper said firefighters had managed to extinguish fires at an oil storage facility, a tourist center, hotel and textile factory.         Officials said communications had been cut off with Leninakan, and state radio in Yerevan reported that roads leading out of that city and Kirovakan were congested with motorists apparently trying to flee.         Casualties were reported in two other Soviet Caucasus republics - Azerbaijan and Georgia - and at least four deaths from the collapse of 50 houses were reported in eastern Turkey by that country's state press.         The quake compounded the difficulties already facing Armenia, which, along with the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan, has been convulsed in recent weeks by interethnic conflicts that have killed more than 30 people.         The area's population has risen markedly in recent weeks as settlers have fled ethnic strife between Christian Armenians and Moslem Azerbaijanis, the government newspaper Izvestia said.         There has been a virtual declaration of martial law in the region.         Because of violence between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, about 180,000 refugees reportedly have fled across the border between their two republics in the last three weeks.
