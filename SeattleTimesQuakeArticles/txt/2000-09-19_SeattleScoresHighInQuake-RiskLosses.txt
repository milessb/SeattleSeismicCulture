Seattle, Tacoma and Portland are among urban areas a federal agency says are most at risk of high losses in case of an earthquake, as well as most vulnerable to an earthquake.     The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said yesterday that most dollar losses would occur in California metropolitan areas. However, Seattle, Tacoma and Portland ranked high in both categories.     The agency says the high risk and projected losses come from the combination of high seismic hazard and relatively high economic exposure.     FEMA estimates annual earthquake losses in the United States at $4.4 billion a year.
