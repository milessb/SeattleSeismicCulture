PALMER, Alaska (AP) _ A strong earthquake shook a remote area of Alaska's panhandle and Canada yesterday, but caused no reported damage or injuries, officials said.        The temblor, which measured 5.0 on the Richter scale, occurred in the late afternoon and was centered in southeast Alaska about 100 miles northwest of Juneau, said George Carte of Alaska Tsunami Warning Center here.        ``An earthquake of this magnitude can sometimes be very damaging in a populated area but this was in a very remote area,'' said Carte.        The quake was felt the strongest in the village of Pelican, about 80 miles south of the epicenter, Carte said.        The quake was felt from Juneau to Yakutat, on the coast about 200 miles to the northwest, and in Whitehorse, in Canada's Yukon Territory, said Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
