TOKYO â€” A powerful magnitude-7.2 earthquake struck northeastern Japan today, triggering two small tsunamis and shaking skyscrapers as far away as Tokyo, 185 miles to the south. At least 27 people were reported injured. A caved-in roof at an indoor pool in the coastal city of Sendai injured 14 people, national broadcaster NHK reported. Others in the quake zone were hurt by falling rocks and tumbling roof tiles. Television footage showed a collapsed house outside Tokyo and landslides in the quake-hit area. "The horizontal shaking was very strong, so much so that I almost couldn't remain standing," said Masami Oshima, an official with Miyagi prefecture, which includes Sendai. The quake knocked out power to about 17,000 households, while bullet-train services in northern Japan were suspended and flights were temporarily grounded at Tokyo's Haneda airport. The quake hit around 11:46 a.m. local time and was centered 12 miles below the ocean floor about 50 miles off the coast of Miyagi in northeastern Japan, the Meteorological Agency said. Two tsunamis that were originally forecast to be 20 inches in height hit the coast with 4-inch waves; officials expected little damage. Tsunami waves are often barely noticeable in the ocean but can rise to great heights once they arrive at shore. The quake was followed by at least four aftershocks and additional quakes of up to magnitude 6 could follow, the agency said. In 1995, a magnitude-7.3 quake in the western port city of Kobe killed 6,400 people. The depth and offshore location of today's quake helped limit the damage that might have occurred had the earthquake been centered under a city.
