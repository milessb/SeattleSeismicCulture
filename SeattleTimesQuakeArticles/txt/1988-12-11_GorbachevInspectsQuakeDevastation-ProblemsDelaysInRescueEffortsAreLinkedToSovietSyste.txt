Shadowed by scenes of devastation and sorrow, President Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday toured areas of Armenia destroyed by an earthquake on Wednesday that the government said has left at least 45,000 dead, 12,000 injured and 500,000 homeless        As Gorbachev inspected the twisted wreckage of buildings, met with local officials and talked with survivors, authorities struggled to cope with an almost numbing series of problems and concerns that have plagued rescue efforts.        They include a shortage of medical treatment centers, a breakdown in the area's transportation system, insufficient rescue equipment and the knowledge that every hour, additional victims buried in the debris were dying.        Gorbachev, who cut short his overseas trip to return to Moscow early on Friday, flew from Moscow yesterday morning to the stricken region in northwest Armenia.        A dramatic series of black-and-white photographs broadcast on the evening television news showed Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, surrounded by crowds of survivors in the city of Leninakan, one of the population centers hardest hit by the earthquake.        Obviously moved by the encounters, Gorbachev stood amid the ruins, citizens pressing against him, as security agents halted the normal practice of maintaining 4 or 5 feet of open space around the leader.        ``We need first and foremost machinery! We don't have enough powerful cranes,'' Tass quoted one man as shouting to Gorbachev.        In one scene, Mrs. Gorbachev embraced a survivor as her husband looked on sadly.        Soviet officials told a news conference in Moscow yesterday that the official toll provided by the government, at least 45,000, was a preliminary estimate and would probably increase as the rubble was cleared.        They said higher figures that had been mentioned this past week, ranging up to 100,000 deaths, appeared unfounded, at least for the moment.        Tremors still were being felt in the Soviet-Turkish border area yesterday, and seismologists warned a less powerful quake could strike anytime.        After his tour of Leninakan, Gorbachev went to the Armenian capital of Yerevan to meet with a Politburo task force.        In Yerevan, which was hardly touched by the quake, Gorbachev found weeping women and buildings draped in black flags. Officials said many men left Yerevan to join rescue teams in the quake area.        Foreign newsmen in Yerevan - the first allowed in Armenia - saw roads around Yerevan's Zvarnots Airport clogged with relief vehicles. Fog slowed emergency airlifts of supplies from throughout the Soviet Union and abroad.        College students who helped in the rescue returned to Yerevan with tales of vast destruction.        ``Five homes remain in Spitak. That is all. The rest are destroyed. You can't describe it. You have to see it,'' Arsen Minasyan, a student at an agricultural institute, said.        Another student, Tanya Kezorkian, a New Yorker going to school in Yerevan, watched rescue attempts at one building in Leninakan, a city of 250,000 people.        ``In four hours, they took four people out. But they say there were 250 people in there. That is the pattern,'' she said.        The government said that 1,500 people pinned beneath the heaps of rubble were freed in the last 24 hours and taken to hospitals for treatment.        How many others remain buried but alive was unknown.        Thousands of Soviet troops, already in the region in the wake of months of ethnic violence, searched for survivors with help from specialist teams from France, Switzerland and Britain.        The earthquake, which struck the mountainous northwest area of Armenia minutes before noon on Wednesday, flattened entire communities, leaving thousands of people trapped under crumpled buildings in Leninakan, Kirovakan, and other urban centers.        The town of Spitak, with a population of 30,000, was completely leveled, and will have to be entirely rebuilt.        Tass interviewed Vanik Shemoyan, a sugar factory engineer in Spitak.        ``My youngest son, along with all his classmates, perished during a class,'' he said. ``In other families, children have been orphaned. I took two such kids, and I will try to become a good father to them.''        As the earth shook, according to newspaper and television reports, trains were derailed and tracks obliterated by landslides, cars and trucks were tossed off the roads like toys, factories and apartment houses collapsed and thousands of fires were ignited by broken gas and electric lines.        In many ways, weaknesses of the Soviet system have been magnified in the aftermath of the quake and the chaotic relief efforts.        Soviet construction techniques and standards are notoriously poor, with a heavy reliance on prefabricated structures slapped together by indifferent workers. Scientists consider this to be one of the reasons so many buildings collapsed.        Yuri Chaplygin, a government spokesman, told a news conference in Moscow yesterday that 125 apartment buildings in Leninakan collapsed.        Construction questions were raised on Friday by the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, which asked in a front-page article: ``Where were the seismologists, architects and builders - the people who designed and built houses that collapsed like matchboxes?''        The backward state of Soviet medicine, an embarrassment to many Russians and a problem Gorbachev has promised to correct, has left many victims without adequate care.        Valentin Nikiforov, a deputy foreign minister, told the news conference that the Soviet Union urgently needed medical equipment and medicine for the treatment of people injured in the earthquake, a rare public acknowledgment that Moscow could not handle the emergency alone.        The uneven industrial development of the country has been seen in the absence of enough cranes and heavy machinery to clear debris. Chaplygin, the government spokesman, said dozens of cranes were being shipped to Armenia.        ``We desperately need more equipment to help with the removal of concrete slabs and other debris,'' he said.        The arrival of ambulances, trucks, cranes and other equipment has been hampered by the destruction of long stretches of the main north-south rail line that runs from Tbilisi, the capital of the neighboring republic of Georgia, through Leninakan to Yerevan.        Roads in the earthquake area were damaged, and have been clogged with traffic as survivors have attempted to flee to unscathed areas.        The overlapping, often snarled lines of authority in the government, and between Moscow and the republics, apparently have also impeded rescue.        A Politburo commission established to deal with the disaster criticized the rescue effort on Friday, saying reaction to the earthquake had been slow and inadequate in some areas.        All these problems were exacerbated by a state of shock that left many officials in Armenia unable to focus on the rescue effort, Chaplygin said.        ``People were more concerned at first with the fate of relatives and with funerals,'' he said.    --  This report includes information from Associated Press and United Press International.Caption:  PHOTOAP / TASS: HOMELESS QUAKE VICTIMS SET UP HOUSEKEEPING ON THE MEDIAN STRIP OF A BOULEVARD IN THE CITY OF LENINAKAN.AP / TASS: SOVIET PRESIDENT MIKHAIL GORBACHEV AND HIS WIFE, RAISA, SPEAK TO RESIDENTS OF THE QUAKE-TORN ARMENIAN CITY OF LENINAKAN
