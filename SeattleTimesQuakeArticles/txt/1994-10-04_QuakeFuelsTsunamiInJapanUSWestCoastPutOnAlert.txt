TOKYO - A strong undersea earthquake jolted northern Japan, shaking buildings 600 miles away in Tokyo. Tidal-wave warnings were issued for the Pacific, including the West Coast of the United States.    Tsunami waves of up to 6 feet high were reported in Japan shortly before midnight.    The quake lasted more than a minute.      There were no immediate reports of major damage or injuries.     However, a fire was reported in a town on Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido,  authorities said.    The National Earthquake Center in Golden, Colo., said the earthquake had a preliminary magnitude of 8.2, the first quake this year to measure more than 8. Earthquakes of magnitude 8 are capable of causing tremendous damage.
