After experiencing three earthquakes since 1971, Dave Niehaus wasn't about to take any chances with No. 4 when it rolled through the Kingdome on Thursday night. The Mariner broadcaster did the only thing that made sense to him: He got up and excused himself by telling his KIRO-radio listeners: "We're out of here." Yesterday, Niehaus said he left the Kingdome and went out to a television equipment truck, where he conducted a post-game show. "I might have had a different reaction if we had been in an outdoor stadium, or if I hadn't been in here (Kingdome) two years ago when the tiles fell," Niehaus said. "I think it was a good thing there were no tiles on the ceiling (Thursday)." The first earthquake Niehaus experienced was in the San Fernando Valley of Southern California in 1971. He and his family were evacuated at 6 a.m. because they lived below a dam in danger of collapsing. He also was in Southern California when earthquakes hit in 1991 and 1994. Niehaus, of course, wasn't the only person anxious to leave when the Kingdome started to shake. Yesterday, Rick Rizzs, Niehaus' broadcast partner, was in an Issaquah-area supermarket talking to the butcher. "He said, `Rick, I was at the game last night and I've got one question: How did Niehaus beat me down the ramp?' " There was no evidence that the earthquake had discouraged anyone - players or fans - from showing up last night to watch the completion of Thursday night's suspended game  and the regularly scheduled game against the Cleveland Indians. "No problems," said M's right-fielder Jay Buhner. Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove had no qualms about bringing his team back to the Kingdome. "From what I saw on television, the building was inspected by city and county people and pronounced sound so there's no reason not to come back," Hargrove said.Caption:  photoDAVE NIEHAUS
