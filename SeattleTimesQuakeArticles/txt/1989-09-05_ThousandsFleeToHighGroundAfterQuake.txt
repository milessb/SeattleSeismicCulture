THOUSANDS FLEE TO HIGH GROUND AFTER QUAKE    PALMER, Alaska        Thousands of people on Kodiak Island and the Alaska Peninsula fled to high ground after a strong earthquake offshore prompted a tsunami warning, but only a small sea wave materialized        The quake yesterday, registering 6.9 on the Richter scale, struck at 5:15 a.m. and was centered about 140 miles southwest of Kodiak Island, said the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo.        In Chignik, the community nearest the quake's center, there were reports that objects fell from shelves and rocks tumbled onto a road, said seismologist George Carte of the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer.        Carte had warned of a possible tsunami in Alaska and British Columbia. More than 5,000 people were evacuated in Kodiak and nearly a dozen smaller communities. The warning was lifted within hours, though, and the evacuees returned to their homes.        Carte said the Tsunami Warning Center's gauge at Sand Point, 180 miles west of the quake's epicenter, recorded a small tsunami of less than one-half foot.        ``I was up in my sister's house and we just woke up to shaking,'' said Sylvia Bravo, 32, a lifelong resident of Chignik.        Bravo said residents heard the tsunami warning through communications radios and went to high ground. She and her family drove to a shelter furnished with food and blankets and stayed there about two hours.        The last damaging tsunami in Alaska happened in the great earthquake of Good Friday 1964. Centered under a glaciated peninsula 75 miles east of Anchorage, the quake generated sea waves estimated up to 80 feet high that devastated Kodiak, obliterated smaller villages along the coast and punished far-off Pacific ports.
