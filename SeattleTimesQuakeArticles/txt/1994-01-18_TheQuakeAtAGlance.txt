Epicenter: Northridge, 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley.     Magnitude: 6.6 on the Richter scale.     Time: 4:31 a.m. Temblor lasted 30 seconds.     Deaths: 34.     Scope: Felt as far as San Diego, 125 miles south, and Las Vegas, 275 miles east.     Damage: There has been no dollar estimate. The 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco area caused $7 billion in damage. As much as three-quarters of the property damage caused by yesterday's quake will not be covered by insurance.     Phone service: Telephone service into the quake-affected area has been intentionally limited to ease service inside the area. The affected area codes are 213, 310, 805 and 818.     Contacting relatives, friends: If you've been unable to contact relatives and friends in Southern California, you can call a local chapter of the American Red Cross. They will take the information and will attempt to trace the person, although tracing won't begin until tomorrow morning at the earliest. The Red Cross numbers: King County, 323-2345; Pierce County, 572-4830; Snohomish County, 252-4103; Kitsap County, 377-3761; national toll-free, 1-800-842-2200.     How you can help: Red Cross officials say the best thing is to make a financial contribution so that needed items can be purchased. Those contributions can be made by sending a check or money order to the Red Cross at 1900 25th Ave. S., Seattle, WA 98144 (note the contribution is for California earthquake victims) or by credit card by calling one of the numbers listed above. For a list of other organizations providing relief, please see A 9.    Business: Customers and companies interested in the status of Southern California businesses can call a toll-free number, 1-800-234-3867, provided by Dun & Bradstreet.     Travel: Los Angeles International Airport and most of the other airports in the affected area are open after closing for a short time yesterday morning. However, officials are discouraging unnecessary travel into the area. Amtrak traffic between San Francisco and Los Angeles was disrupted; passengers can call 1-800-USA-RAIL for more information.
