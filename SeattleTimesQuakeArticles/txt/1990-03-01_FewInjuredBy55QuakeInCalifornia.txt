UPLAND, Calif. - Southern Californians from the desert to the beach were unnerved but mostly unharmed yesterday by a 5.5-magnitude earthquake that shattered windows, triggered rockslides and caused millions of dollars in damage in Pomona and surrounding communities        No injuries more serious than broken legs were reported in the 3:43 p.m. quake, which shook for up to 15 seconds and was centered about three miles northwest of Upland in San Bernardino County. But it caused considerable damage in San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties.        The quake was felt from Santa Barbara to San Diego and as far east as Las Vegas, some 250 miles away. It was California's strongest temblor since the 7.1-magnitude Loma Prieta earthquake killed 67 people in Northern California in October.        At least 19 aftershocks measuring 2.5 or greater were recorded within seven hours of yesterday's  quake, and the California Office of Emergency Services issued a warning that aftershocks were likely to continue for the next three days. The largest aftershock yesterday was 4.8 at 7:24 p.m.        Pomona officials set a preliminary damage estimate of $7 million and declared more than 100 buildings unsafe, pending a more thorough inspection today.        Other cities declaring emergencies were Claremont, Upland and La Verne, where the wall of an auto-parts store collapsed and 35 other buildings were damaged.        Hardest hit were a First Interstate Bank building and City Hall in Pomona, where dozens of panes of smoked glass popped from their frames and shattered into jagged shards. The parks and recreation office was left in ruins.        In Upland, a ruptured natural-gas line sparked a fire that destroyed a house, and 15 people were evacuated from an apartment building rendered unsafe. Two others suffered broken legs.        The 5.5-magnitude shock followed a 3.6-magnitude one three hours earlier, according to seismologists at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.        The earthquake triggered at least 15 landslides along several miles of Mount Baldy Road in San Bernardino County, sending huge boulders into the roadway, which snakes through the mountains. Public-works crews used plow trucks to clear a path through the rocks and dirt.Caption:  MAPKNIGHT-RIDDER TRIBUNE NEWS: CENTER OF EARTHQUAKE (MAP NOT IN ELECTRONIC VERSION)
