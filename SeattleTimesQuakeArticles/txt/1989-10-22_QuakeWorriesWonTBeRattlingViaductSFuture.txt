Simultaneously, a single thought zapped through the minds of thousands of people Wednesday:         ``I'm never driving south on the Alaskan Way Viaduct again.''         That conclusion was prompted by the repeated images of Oakland's I-880.         Following was a second thought: ``Maybe now we can tear it down.''         But that's not likely.         Throughout the week, one analysis has followed another, with pictures of I-880 and the Alaskan Way Viaduct on TV specials and newspaper pages.         Always, the ultimate question was the same: Can Seattle's viaduct fall down in an earthquake? Can hundreds of cars be crushed between the upper and lower decks, just as they were in Oakland?         Always, in form or another, the answer was the same: No one knows.         Actually it's been suggested that the Alaskan Way Viaduct be torn down because it forms a wall between downtown and the waterfront.         U.S. Rep. John Miller, R-Seattle, teamed up with Bruce Chapman when both were City Council members in 1974 to suggest destroying the viaduct.         The new West Seattle Bridge, they said, would make the viaduct unnecessary. Such thoughts dated back to at least 1970, when Peter Best, a city Planning Commission member, mentioned that taking down the viaduct might be a good idea.         A study by a now-gone engineering firm, George Rockwise & Associates, thought replacing it with a tunnel could work, but came up with a concept-destroying cost figure: $70 million in 1971 dollars.         Tearing it down is just as unlikely today as ever, I-880 notwithstanding.         Seattle's geography plays a role, as it always does in road stuff, and one place it shows up is in a colorful map produced by the city Engineering Department.         Designed to make street widths correspond to their traffic density, the map shows a big wide blue streak through downtown that's labeled I-5. The freeway carries about 247,000 cars a day.         The second-widest streak on the map is the Alaskan Way Viaduct. It carries 89,500 vehicles a day. Very few other streets even come close; I-90 carries 67,000 cars a day, Aurora Avenue handles 74,100.         Gary Zarker, the city's engineering director, has a simple answer about whether it would be possible to tear down the viaduct: ``No!''         He also poses the converse question. ``Can you imagine the outcry if I was to propose something like that today?'' (Nope, I can't.)         Moving the viaduct's traffic to city streets would be an impossibility, says Zarker. It's probably worth recalling that one of the reasons justifying the viaduct in the first place was that it took a city councilman more than an hour to get from Stewart Street to City Hall.         ``To put that kind of traffic on city streets, I don't see how it could be handled,'' Zarker says.         What's more likely is that the viaduct will be strengthened to resist earthquakes, making it more massive than ever. Hmmm, a viaduct collapses in California, and we get a bigger one here.
