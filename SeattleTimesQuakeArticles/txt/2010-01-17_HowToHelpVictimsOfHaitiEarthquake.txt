Some tips from InterAction, a coalition of U.S.-based international nongovernmental organizations: • Why cash is best: Donating cash to established aid groups is the best way to help because it allows professionals to get exactly what they need and does not use up scarce resources such as transportation, sorting time or warehouse space. • If you give supplies: If you decide to donate supplies and not cash, contact an established relief agency before you collect anything. If you have already collected items, donate them to a relief group in your community or sell them at a yard sale or charity auction and donate the proceeds. • If you want to volunteer: People who want to volunteer should have previous disaster or international experience or technical skills and should work through a relief agency.
