OAK HARBOR, Island County A mild earthquake rattled Whidbey Island, the northern Olympic Peninsula and southern Vancouver Island, but no injuries or damage were reported.    The University of Washington said the quake that occurred shortly after 8 p.m. yesterday measured 3.4 on the Richter scale. It was centered about 12 miles west of Oak Harbor in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and about 11 miles deep.    "It doesn't really have any geological significance, other than to remind us that we live in an earthquake area," said Gary Rogers, head seismologist at the Pacific Geoscience Centre in Victoria.
