Fifty Washington Natural Gas workers have been sent from the Puget Sound area to help restore gas service to some 80,000 Californians who remain without it since last week's earthquake.        The assistance was requested by Pacific Gas & Electric of California.        Washington Natural Gas personnel, who are expected to return home by the end of the week, included 20 people who normally work in Seattle, 15 from eastern King County, 10 from the Tacoma area, two from Auburn and three from Olympia.        While in California, they will turn gas meters back on and relight gas appliances.        The Oregon division of Northwest Natural Gas Co. sent 40 employees to the Bay Area. The Oregon workers, who were carrying gas-leakage indicators, came from the company's Portland, Salem, Albany and Eugene service areas.        ``We are glad that we can be of help to the people of California, and we ask our own customers' patience for a few days during this time of emergency,'' said Washington Natural Gas President Robert Golliver.
