MOSCOW _ About 10 people died in a powerful earthquake that rocked the central Asian republic of Tadzhikistan on Sunday night, a local journalist said today.        The journalist, from the republic's official daily, Kommunista Tadzhikstana, who was contacted by telephone, said damage in the three cities hit by the quake was slight.        ``Nothing disastrous has happened,'' she said from the republic's capital, Dushanbe. ``I believe not many people, around 10, have died.''        Transport and water supplies were not affected and communications were quickly restored.        The quake was believed to be the country's strongest in almost a decade. A Seismological Institute official in Moscow said yesterday it measured 6.1 on the Richter scale.        Last night's television news, in a report from Dushanbe, showed extensive damage _ a number of houses demolished, trees uprooted and streets broken up.        The government newspaper Izvestia, in the fullest report of the quake so far, said yesterday that the epicenter was at Kayrakkum, a town close to Tashkent, capital of neighboring Uzbekistan. Tashkent is the fourth-largest Soviet city with a population of more than 1.9 million, and is a sister city of Seattle.
