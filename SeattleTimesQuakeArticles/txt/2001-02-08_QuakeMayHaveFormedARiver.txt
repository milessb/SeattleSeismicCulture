NEW DELHI--The earthquake in the arid district of Kutch in western India last month may have revived an underground channel of water that had been lying dormant for years, the Indian Express said yesterday. The newspaper said pictures taken by satellite last Thursday, nearly a week after the devastating quake in Gujarat state, showed water in a zigzag channel leading to the marshy Rann of Kutch. It said pictures taken before the quake confirmed that water could not be seen then. Indian Space Research Organization Deputy Director R.R. Navalgunde told the newspaper that an explanation would require extensive studies. He said salt water may been squeezed out by the Jan. 26 earthquake, which measured 7.7 on the Richter scale. An estimated 30,000 people were killed. Gujarat Irrigation Secretary M.S. Patel said water from Bhuj and Bhachau, which frequently tastes brackish, had reportedly become sweeter since the quake. But villagers in some areas reported the opposite effect, saying their livestock was dying because the animals would not drink the now-salty water. But the satellite images may not be easy to come by for experts wishing to study the phenomenon. The Press Trust of India said the photos will not be made available even to relief workers because they cover sensitive defense installations close to the border with  Pakistan.&nbsp;
