Candlestick Park was dark and quiet now, only a few lights were on. It was 4 a.m. yesterday and Al Michaels, preparing to go on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' walked in the outfield with Curt Gowdy Jr., ABC's baseball producer         ``It was an eerie feeling,'' Gowdy said. ``The grass was green and it was wet and I just thought to myself how lucky I was, how lucky everybody in the stadium was, and how tragic and unfortunate it was for other people in this area.''        The calm Gowdy and Michaels experienced in Candlestick Park couldn't erase the memory of what had transpired Tuesday night. The memory of the earthquake won't soon leave the minds of sportscaster who became newscasters for a night.        Michaels was tired when we talked Wednesday night. He had slept about 45 minutes since the quake hit. He said to excuse him if he rambled. No apologies were necessary; he made perfect sense. The memory of Tuesday night was still fresh in his mind.        ``I knew exactly what it was at first,'' said Michaels, who resided in the San Francisco Bay area for 12 years. ``I was fully aware there was an earthquake in progress. I was working at a very intense state of concentration because it was the opening of a telecast.        ``There were a lot of things that I had to do. Get (Tim) McCarver in, we're rolling (video) tape and I'm making the transition over to Jim (Palmer),'' he said. ``It was one of those situations, where if someone stuck a pencil in my side, I probably would've jumped five feet.''        But this was no jab with a pencil.         It was an earthquake. The real deal. Michaels, Palmer and McCarver were in the broadcast booth, their backs to the field.        ``It (the rumbling of the quake) seemed to get stronger as it went along,'' Michaels said. ``It wasn't abating and then I became petrified. I felt like I was being pitched backward and that the upper deck was going into the lower deck.''        Michaels and his boothmates waited for the next big jolt. Fortunately, it never came. But like a captain lost at sea, Michaels knew he had to re-establish a link of communication with the people in ABC's production truck.        ``I wasn't aware of it, but I began screaming, `Where's my communication? Where's my communication?' The sense I had was that I was the link to the world and all my communication was out. No picture. Not anything,'' he said. ``There was a period of intense frustration. I wasn't scared at that moment, all the shaking and rolling had stopped. But I just had nowhere to go.''        The frustration soon would end. Michaels was guided down to the production area, where he would soon hook up with Ted Koppel.         On Tuesday night, he let millions of viewers know he is much more than a play-by-play guy.        A critic can sit back and rip or praise, but it's the people who give a sense of what really went down. All over town yesterday people said things such as: ``Did you see Al Michaels? He did some kind of job. He knew just how to handle the situation.''        ABC News executives knew what they were doing when they told Michaels he would be working with Koppel. Yes, the man lived in Menlo Park, Calif., about 20 minutes from Candlestick, but he wasn't brought in just to give Koppel a geography lesson.        ``I love geography. I'm a map freak. . . . But when I got to the truck and saw the picture of the Bay Bridge that's all I needed to know. I wanted to convey a sense that everyone at Candlestick was okay,'' he said. ``I don't remember anything I said, but I tried to convey the sense of what it is to live through this and what it must feel like.        Michaels felt no pressure. The body of work he has done during his career made him feel at ease working the news side. ``My life has included paying attention to a lot of things,'' he said. ``I have a wonderful job, I make a great living and I love what I'm doing. I love sports, but I'm not consumed with it.        ``I knew the basics. I knew a foundation had to be laid down for the people,'' he said. ``Your mind is racing so fast, you're thinking about so many things, you just do the best you can.''        Many of you know Michaels as the guy who presented the ``Do you believe in miracles?'' line after the U.S. hockey team upset the Soviets in the 1980 Winter Olympics.         Tuesday night, his career took another turn. A positive turn negotiated on a national stage under impossible circumstances.        But as he tried winding down, he wasn't thinking about the job he did during the quake report or on ``Nightline'' or ``Good Morning America.'' See, he loves San Francisco, the place they call The City. The devastation he saw on the street was tough to take.        Michaels and his wife arrived at their hotel at 5 a.m. and walked up to their room on the 13th floor.        ``Then,'' Michaels said. ``I sat down and cried.'Caption:  PHOTOAL MICHAELS -- MORE PLAY-BY-PLAY GUY
