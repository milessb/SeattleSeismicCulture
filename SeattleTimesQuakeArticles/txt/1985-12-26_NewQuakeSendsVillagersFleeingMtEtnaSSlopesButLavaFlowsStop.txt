CATANIA, Sicily _ An earth tremor sent thousands of villagers fleeing their homes in panic today near the slopes of Mount Etna, which erupted Christmas Day, killing one man and injuring 14 others.        Europe's most active volcano began spewing red-hot smoke and lava at 3:45 a.m. yesterday, setting off a series of earthquakes that demolished a hotel but subsided later in the day.        The lava has stopped flowing, but just 24 hours after the first rumblings on the volcano slopes, another sharp tremor shook the village of Zafferana. The jolt sent residents running from their homes in the dark. Several buildings were slightly damaged, but no injuries were reported.        Today's shock was measured at 3.7 on the Richter scale. The initial quake yesterday was recorded at 5.0.        Carmelo Di Stefano, 34, was killed by a falling roof beam as the Birches Hotel collapsed under the stress of the first Christmas Day tremors. He was trying to pull his family from the building.        The Christmas Day quakes, some measuring up to 4.4 on the Richter scale, continued but with lessening force into the afternoon. Molten rock streamed out of the side of the volcano from a fissure about 8,800 feet above sea level after the initial eruption and split into four branches. It had travelled about three miles by last night, but geologists said it posed no danger to inhabited areas.        The 11,000-foot volcano _ Europe's tallest and most active _ usually erupts two or three times a year. In 1983, huge lava flows lasting several months rumbled over ski lifts, a cable-car system and vacation cottages.
