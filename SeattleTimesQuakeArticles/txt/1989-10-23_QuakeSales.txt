Quake sales         Nordstrom, Eddie Bauer and Recreational Equipment Inc. were able to open most of their Bay Area stores within a day or two of last week's earthquake - and at least one, REI, is offering some deals on damaged merchandise         Kathleen Beamer of REI said the stores in Berkeley and Cupertino reopened Thursday. ``We'll probably have some sales of water-damaged merchandise in the Cupertino store,'' she said.         Nordstrom had all of its locations open by Saturday, and managed to go ahead with the grand opening of its first store in Sacramento on Friday. Nordstrom reported minor damage to some stores, including the Hillsdale store in San Mateo, where sprinkler systems came on, and the new downtown San Francisco store, where crystal glasses and vases crashed to the floor.
