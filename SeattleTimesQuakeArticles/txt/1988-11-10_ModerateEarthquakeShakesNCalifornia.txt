SAN JOSE, Calif. - A moderate earthquake shook a wide section of Northern California last night, knocking items off grocery shelves but causing no injuries or major damage.         The quake had a magnitude of 4.7 on the Richter scale, according to the University of California at Berkeley's Seismographic Stations. The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park gave a preliminary reading of 4.5, with an epicenter 11 miles northeast of San Jose on the Calaveras Fault.         Most who felt the quake described it as two sharp jolts, but said it was not frightening.         At the Alpha Beta supermarket in San Jose, kitchen items, jar lids and a can fell off the shelves, said clerk Mike Depiro.         ``It was shaking, rattling and rumbling,'' he said. ``I was bagging groceries and I heard things start rumbling and falling, so I paid attention. I just enjoyed it.''         The 9:08 p.m. temblor occurred at about the same location as did a magnitude 5.0 quake June 12. That quake caused slight damage.         Last night's quake was felt in an area stretching at least 200 miles to the north of San Francisco in Eureka; 120 miles to the south in Seaside in Monterey County; and 120 miles to the east in Modesto.         Police in San Francisco, San Jose and several other Bay Area communities reported dozens of phone calls about the temblor, but none received reports of structural damage or injuries.         A quake of magnitude 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate damage, while one of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage.Caption:  MAPAP: EARTHQUAKE: (OUTLINE STATE MAP SHOWS AREA OF QUAKE)
