A strong earthquake struck Mexico City and Acapulco this morning, cracking buildings, shattering glass and sending thousands of panicked people into the streets.        One man was electrocuted when power cables fell on him and two women were seriously injured when they jumped from the second story of a swaying building,  officials said.        The U.S. National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said the earthquake registered 6.8 on the Richter scale. The epicenter was 40 miles east of Acapulco, about 200 miles south of Mexico City, said seismologist John Minsch.        The tremor knocked out power and telephone service in some parts of the city and damaged water lines.        The tremor shook Mexico City at about the same time of day as the large earthquake that struck Sept. 19, 1985, killing at least 10,000 people and knocking down hundreds of buildings. That quake measured 8.1 on the Richter scale.        The Pacific beach resorts of Acapulco and Zihuatanejo were shaken, but there were no reports of death or damage.
