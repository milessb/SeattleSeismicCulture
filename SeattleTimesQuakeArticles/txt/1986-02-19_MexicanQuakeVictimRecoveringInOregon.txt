SALEM (AP) _ A teen-aged girl whose leg was crushed in the Mexico City earthquake last year is recovering well after surgery, one of her benefactors says.        Delores Wyant said Claudia Mendoza, 17, was smiling and radiant following the surgery at Salem Hospital, free from the constant pain she had suffered since her injury.        A physician who wishes to remain anonymous donated his skill in performing the surgery to correct Claudia's leg, which was broken by a falling wall during the Sept. 19 earthquake and had healed improperly.        Wyant, at whose Salem home Claudia will stay while recovering, said the operation involved rebreaking the leg, inserting a metal pin and resetting the break. The trip and operation for Claudia was arranged by Northwest Medical Teams, a Salem-based volunteer relief organization.Caption:  PHOTOAP: MEXICAN EARTHQUAKE VICTIM CLAUDIA MENDOZA, 17, IS RECUPERATING FROM LEG SURGERY.
