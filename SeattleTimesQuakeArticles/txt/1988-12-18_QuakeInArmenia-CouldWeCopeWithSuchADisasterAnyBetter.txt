The subject: emergency preparedness.         Considerable demeaning comment has been heaped upon the Russian government and its handling of search and rescue, etc., after the recent earthquake in Armenia.         We should not waste our time looking anywhere but right here at home.         Could we as citizens, cities, state government and national government cope any better or worse than they?         We are in an earthquake zone. I think we should analyze whether we have any ability to cope with such a disaster.    - Walbridge J. Powell, Mercer Islan
