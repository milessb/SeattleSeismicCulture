Citing bad traffic and a fear of being isolated by a major earthquake, the Washington National Guard wants to move its Seattle armory out of Terminal 91 in Interbay. Proposed bills introduced in the state House and Senate would authorize the move--but only if the Guard could buy land from the proceeds of selling its 25-acre base. Because of traffic, guardsmen are having trouble reaching the armory and then driving military trucks out of town on Friday nights for weekend training at the Yakima Firing Range or Fort Lewis, said Brig. Gen. Lee Legowik of the Army National Guard. And this week's earthquake added urgency to the search. If the Big One struck, Guard leaders think their relief efforts would be hampered as roads and bridges crumbled in an already-congested Seattle. "We'd like to be as close as we can be but don't want to be part of the mass of victims," said Maj. Gen. Tim Lowenberg, head of state Guard operations. The Guard began studying a move two years ago and is consulting the University of Washington seismology lab for help identifying stable sites. National Guard units are mobilized in emergencies: They worked with police during the 1999 World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle and fought a large brush fire in the Yakima Valley last summer. About 8,500 Washington Guard members can be deployed by the governor anywhere in the state. The Seattle outpost could provide shelter, a loading point for trucks and a distribution center  for food, water and supplies. About 600 soldiers and 100 vehicles are based at Interbay. The armory has been there since 1967, after vacating what is now the Center House at Seattle Center to make way for the 1962 World's Fair. The present site borders train tracks and a Port of Seattle auto-import dock but lacks waterfront access. Port officials considered acquiring the property a couple years ago, said Port spokesman Doug Williams, but he was not aware of any recent talks.&nbsp;
