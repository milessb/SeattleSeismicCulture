Now that you're done rockin' and rollin', it's time to relive the Ash Wednesday earthquake (dust to dust, indeed!) with our readers' contest for the best earthquake books and movies. We're looking for fiction that conveys that unsettling feeling, nonfiction that explains earthquakes to the layman, and movies that make you feel that YOU ARE THERE. You were there! You be the judge! We need West Coast nominations! We need movies! We'll settle for television in a pinch! E-mail your nominations to Mary Ann Gwinn, book editor, at       mgwinn@seattletimes.com      , or call her at  206-464-2357.&nbsp;
