QUAKE HASN'T RATTLED SAFECO PROFITS - YET    SEATTLE         Safeco profits soared 63 percent in the third quarter. In releasing its results, the insurer said its damages from the California earthquake will be limited substantially if they rise past $10 million         The massive quake, which wracked the Bay Area last week, won't begin to affect profits until fourth-quarter results are known after the first of the year. But Safeco said that beyond $10 million, its catastrophe-reinsurance coverage pays 60 percent of the next $10 million and 95 percent beyond $20 million.         In the third quarter, Safeco profits were $81.6 million, or $1.29 a share, on sales of $757 million, compared with year-ago profits of $51.3 million, or 79 cents a share, on sales of $693 million. The underwriting loss was $6.8 million, the lowest quarterly figure of the year, made more remarkable because it included $6.2 million in estimated claims from Hurricane Hugo.
