WASHINGTON _ The United States is conducting sensitive negotiations to put new seismic devices in China to monitor Soviet underground nuclear tests, administration and congressional sources said yesterday        The seismic facility, which would be similar to one that became operational last year in Norway, could help verify Soviet compliance with treaties that currently limit and could eventually ban underground nuclear tests, according to the fiscal 1987 Department of Energy budget request to Congress.        A China-based facility would strengthen U.S. capabilities to detect Soviet tests and determine their size when carried out at the Semipalatinsk test site in East Kazakhstan, according to experts outside the government. Chinese territory lies roughly 350 miles from the Semipalatinsk site. The closest seismic facility to the main Soviet test site now is in Norway, roughly 4,000 miles to the northeast.        State and Defense Department officials yesterday refused to comment on the negotiations with China or the proposed facility that was disclosed in the unclassified DOE budget document delivered to Congress two weeks ago.        A spokesman for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which operates the Norwegian seismic array in cooperation with the Oslo government, said the China project ``is a Department of Energy matter and must be discussed with them.''        ``In fiscal 1986,'' according to DOE's fiscal 1987 budget document, ``negotiations began with the People's Republic of China (PRC) on a cooperative effort to culminate in the installation of a regional seismic array in the PRC.''        Construction of the facility would begin next year, but only ``after the U.S. and the PRC have reached agreement on the array installation,'' according to the DOE presentation. The Soviet Union last summer announced a unilateral halt to underground testing and unsuccessfully urged the United States to follow suit. Moscow recently announced that it would continue its moratorium until the United States conducts its next test, now scheduled for late April.        The Norwegian seismic facility, believed to be the same type planned for China, has already sharply increased U.S. monitoring capabilities.
