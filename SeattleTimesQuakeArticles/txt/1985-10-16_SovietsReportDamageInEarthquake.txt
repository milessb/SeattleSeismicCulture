MOSCOW (AP) _ Soviet news reports today said that an earthquake in Tadzhikistan left more than 8,000 people homeless and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.        The reports said the Sunday night quake caused deaths, but the state-controlled press has not said how many.        One press report said more than 1,000 people were working in a rug factory when the quake struck and that rescue workers were still at the site.        The government newspaper Izvestia said 8,000 of the city of Kayrakkum's 15,000 residents were left homeless.        Preliminary estimates were that the quake caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to homes, office buildings, factories and other structures, Izvestia said.        The paper said the quake damaged the Kairakkum city hospital and cut off its electricity.
