LOS ANGELES - From the outside, the school Hillary Rodham Clinton visited in South Central Los Angeles didn't seem damaged by the earthquake. But inside, the children were still feeling the shakes and rumbles    Students at Hyde Park Elementary School told the first lady yesterday about shaking beds, screaming mothers and flying glass. Some told her they still couldn't sleep at night.    Clinton held their hands, listened carefully and praised their bravery.    "I can't imagine not being scared," she said.    Clinton visited Los Angeles yesterday to tour the earthquake-hit areas and to accept an award at AIDS Project L.A., a major AIDS benefit.    When the children asked Clinton whether she had felt the earthquake and whether she had been scared, she drew them a map of the United States on the blackboard. Then she showed them where Washington is in relation to Los Angeles.
