FAIRBANKS, Alaska - An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude was recorded yesterday just after midnight in the south-central part of the state, the Alaska Earthquake Information Center said.    The epicenter of the quake was 35 miles west northwest of Talkeetna, EIC spokesman Guy Tytgat said.    But because of its depth - 53 miles - no one there felt it, he said. No damage was reported.
