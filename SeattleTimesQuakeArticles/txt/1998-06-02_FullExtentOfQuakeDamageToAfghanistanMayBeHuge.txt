FAIZABAD, Afghanistan - The zone of devastation left by an earthquake which killed thousands of Afghans may be far larger than previously thought, aid workers said today.     Joerg Stoecklin, spokesman for the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross, said that Saturday's tremor, 7.1 on the Richter scale, appeared to have hit a wider area than at first feared and triggered many more landslides.     The Red Cross said it had found 1,000 people wounded in the disaster but had yet to find any survivors trapped in the rubble of devastated houses.     He said the Red Cross was declining to estimate the death toll - which other aid agencies have put at 4,000 - simply because it was too early to make an accurate assessment.      The area is home to about 60,000 people.     Yesterday, aftershocks jolted northern Afghanistan, keeping the traumatized people away from their homes, or what is left of them.     The United Nations says the three worst-affected areas are Shar-i-Buzurg, Rustaq and Chah-ab. Rustaq bore the brunt of a quake in February measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale, which killed up to 4,000 people.
