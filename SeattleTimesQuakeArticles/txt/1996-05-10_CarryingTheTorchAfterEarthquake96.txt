Whatever it takes, the biggest team of Dumpster-diving journalism professionals in Seattle is ready with all the broadcast news for Western Washington. Plus your acute-weather forecast first and, finally, in a special report, a look behind the scenes at - The Seattle Times! We'll meet columnist Erik Lacitis! He's interviewing us for his column, too      Not really! But we do have news about broadcasting. And in this ratings month, how lucky can those TV-news people get?      First, the earthquake. What an opportunity to show your stuff! Wall-to-wall coverage ensued that night, May 2. But not everyone was impressed. For one thing, KING-TV bailed out of a special one-hour episode of "Seinfeld" and opted out of "ER" altogether.      Uh-oh.          A lot of people took to the phones to complain that "Must See TV," as NBC calls its prime-time juggernaut, had become "Can't-See TV."        The "ER" episode will air May 28 on KING at 10 p.m. But the "Seinfeld" episode is lost - at least until the network reruns it nationally or it goes into syndication.       How come? NBC says the contractual complications are enormous. Everyone has to get a slice of the action when programs are shown, and airing "Seinfeld" again - that 21-minute fragment counts, apparently, as if it were an hour - would be a bookkeeping nightmare, blah, blah, blah.        An estimated 344,300 households in the Seattle-Tacoma market were watching "Seinfeld" that night, but the show nationally drew viewers in 21.1 million households. We're not worth the trouble.     There were other reasons people weren't pleased with the attention the quake got.     Lee Holdren of Bellevue writes: "For over three hours of continuous coverage they screamed and hollered, repeating themselves ad infinitum, trying their best to pump up their image." (A savvy viewer, this Holdren fellow.) "Truthfully, the story probably rated a quick bulletin saying there was no significant damage and then maybe a couple of pictures at the regular news period."      A resident of epicenter Duvall called us to complain that the TV-helicopter noise up that way was far more irritating than the quake itself.       Was local TV coverage over the top, or was it a justifiable wake-up call for the Big One? Speaking of which, if we have another quake this year, will television call its coverage "Earthquake '96 version 1.1"?           Nielsen Media Research ratings show post-"Seinfeld" KING held on pretty well to its usual stratospheric Thursday-night rating by covering the quake, but so did KSTW-TV, which stayed with the Sonics game that night.       Dumping "Seinfeld" is one thing. But hey, a Sonics playoff game? As KSTW's current ad campaign says, "Whatever it takes" - within reason.          Proud as a peacock: Olympic commercialism hit home this week and, to be honest, KING-TV handled it with a modicum of restraint. Seattle TV icon and KING co-anchor Jean Enersen got to carry the Olympic torch for a few blocks along Alaskan Way. How could you not share her excitement?       Compatriot Dennis Bounds, back at the studio, pointed out that while most of the torch-bearers were local heroes of one sort or another, sponsor Coca-Cola gets to anoint people who are simply "prominent in the community" - Enersen being one.       That's fine, but don't forget that there are three other TV stations in town doing news, and they happen to be affiliated with networks other than NBC, which has exclusive rights to cover the Atlanta Games.          Puget Sound bites: Classical KING-FM (98.1) has launched a weekly program for children called "Classic KID-FM," hosted by Marta Zekan and airing Saturdays from 8 to 10 a.m. . . . With little fanfare, MSNBC got its site on the World Wide Web of the Internet up and running this week, with content complementing the visit by NBC's "Today" show to Ireland. Watch for more special tie-ins before NBC and Microsoft launch the real deal - the all-news MSNBC cable channel and online news service - in July. The address: www.msnbc.com TV-Radio Beat appears every Friday in The Seattle Times. Electronic-media reporter Chuck Taylor can be reached at (206) 464-8524 or on the Internet at ctay-new@seatimes.co
