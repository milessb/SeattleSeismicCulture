``Wild Oats'' by John O'Keeffe. Produced by the Bathhouse Theater, 7312 W. Green Lake Dr. N., through Oct. 27. Information: 524-9108.         The Bathhouse Theater's merry band of players sowed ``Wild Oats'' last night, and the company's box office should reap an ample harvest.         ``Wild Oats'' is a juicy English comedy, written in 1791 by John O'Keeffe, who was praised as ``the English Moliere'' by no less a critic than William Hazlitt. But O'Keeffe's plays (about 70 of them) went unperformed for more than a century and a half until the Royal Shakespeare Company revived ``Wild Oats'' in 1976.         The play has more plot than a full season of TV sitcoms and more energy than City Light. It's a wonderful flying-off-in-all-directions romp, whose high spirits are channeled expertly by director Arne Zaslove, the Bathhouse's resident genie.         At the center of the madcap action is Rover, a trouping actor, who does everything to hilarious excess, including peppering his dialogue with quotations from the Shakespearean roles he's played. Rex McDowell sails into the role with enormous gusto and skill. He has, and creates, great fun.         At the epicenter of this farcical earthquake is a ``robustious periwigged fellow (who) tear(s) a passion to tatters.'' O'Keeffe named the character Sir George Thunder, and that's more than a small clue. John Aylward, an actor who picks up more clues (and cues) than most, is ripping and roaring and rip-roaring in the role.         Like many of its less muscular Restoration-comedy cousins, ``Wild Oats'' deals in amorous dalliances, mistaken identities and the sundry connivances that are necessary to tie up the deliberate excess of loose ends.         The play is a wonderful vehicle for the Bathhouse's talented, disciplined resident company, because it gives the actors marvelous acting (and over-acting) opportunities. It will surprise no one who knows Zaslove's work to know that the production revels in high-energy theatricality _ even more than usual, because the play itself already is playing theatrical games.         Allen Galli is a hoot as Sir George's valet; Gretchen Orsland is a sweet, rich lady who falls for Rover (and vice versa, but without the vice); Craig Huisenga is the lady's oily steward; Andy Taylor is Sir George's son who has given up his studies for life on the stage but then changes his mind and (oh, never mind); William Crossett is funny as a farmer; Mark Anders and Dylan Marshall are even funnier as his children.         They and all the other members of the company obviously have fun in playing with O'Keeffe's games-playing play. The set by Shelley Henze Schermer, the costumes by Julie James, the lights by Judy Wolcott: All are just right.       The more familiarity you have with Shakespeare, the more you'll find to laugh at. But such knowledge is no prerequisite for enjoying another in the long list of successes at the BathhouseCaption:  PHOTOFRED ANDREWS / BATHHOUSE THEATER: REX MCDOWELL AND ANDY TAYLOR APPEAR IN THE BATHHOUSE THEATER'S PRODUCTION OF THE RESTORATION COMEDY `WILD OATS,' WHICH RUNS THROUGH OCT. 27.
