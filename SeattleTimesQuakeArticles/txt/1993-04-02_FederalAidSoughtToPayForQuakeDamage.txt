SALEM, Ore.      Gov. Barbara Roberts has decided to ask President Clinton for a disaster declaration to help pay for repairing damage inflicted across three Oregon counties by last week's earthquake.     Roberts yesterday said she would seek grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, to help local governments repair public facilities damaged by the earthquake in Clackamas, Marion and Yamhill counties.     Roberts also will sign a letter to the U.S. Small Business Administration seeking a separate emergency declaration to allow aid, including low-interest loans, for repairs to private homes and businesses.    Experts have found $6.3 million worth of qualifying damage to public facilities in Clackamas, Yamhill and Marion counties, Roberts' spokesman Steve Corson said. They found another $6.2 million in damage to private businesses and $1.6 million in damage to private homes, he said.    Marion County officials have estimated damage in their county at $20 million, including nearly $14 million at Mount Angel alone.    The totals do not include damage to state buildings or state highways, which are self-insured or covered by a state insurance policy. The greatest damage to state buildings occurred at the Capitol, where repair costs have been estimated at $850,000.
