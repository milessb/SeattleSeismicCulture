Forty-six Northwest doctors, nurses and paramedics left Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for Soviet Armenia this morning with a planeload of medical equipment and supplies.         They are believed to be the first and so far only private American medical group being allowed into the Soviet Union to aid in earthquake relief efforts.         The group flew aboard a Flying Tiger-donated Boeing 747 crammed with medicine, diagnostic machines, two portable operating rooms, generators, tents, food, clothing and a team of rescue dogs from Alaska. Nearly all of the materials on the airplane were donated by area hospitals and individuals.         The relief team includes 30 members organized by the Seattle-King County Disaster Team, a private all-volunteer group that helped victims of the Mexico City earthquake in 1985, and 16 members from Portland.         They were scheduled to fly to New York, where additional donated supplies will be loaded. They will then fly directly to Yerevan, the capital city of Armenia. What they will do upon arrival is uncertain, said Roy Farrell, medical director of the team.         The team is equipped to be ``totally self-contained,'' both in terms of the services it can give and the ability to feed and house its own members. The only support the team will need from the Soviets is transportation, but Farrell said the team did not know where the Soviets would want them to work.         The team includes surgeons, emergency physicians, emergency nurses and a pharmacist.         Their efforts to give aid had been stymied by the Soviet bureaucracy, Farrell said, until they got help from by Bob Walsh, president of the Seattle Organizing Committee of the 1990 Goodwill Games. Walsh, who has had extensive dealings with the Soviets because of the games, interceded and helped secure permission.         Walsh said the group was being allowed in without visas being issued in advance, to his knowledge the first time that has ever occurred.         The group is expected to remain in Armenia a week to 10 days.
