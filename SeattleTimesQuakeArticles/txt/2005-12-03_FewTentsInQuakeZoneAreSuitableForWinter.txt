MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan â€” Aid officials warned Friday that almost all of the hundreds of thousands of tents distributed to quake survivors in Pakistan will not protect against the harsh Himalayan winter. Pakistan's army said it was constructing 5,000 shelters a day out of corrugated metal for the 3.5 million people left homeless amid fears of a second wave of deaths as conditions worsen in the coming weeks. An estimated 87,000 died in the Oct. 8 temblor, which caused devastation across a vast swath of Pakistan and India, mostly in Kashmir, the disputed Himalayan region divided between them. Cold weather set in last month, and hundreds of people stream into hospitals every day for cold-related ailments. In Islamabad, Darren Boisvert, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, said 420,000 tents have been distributed in Pakistan but "90 percent are not winterized." "Winterized tents are expensive, they are hard to procure, and must be shipped from overseas," he said. Boisvert said relief efforts have focused on the highest mountain villages, rather than the hundreds of thousands living in nonwinterized tents in refugee camps at lower elevations. He said 5,000 tents that are adequate for winter have been distributed to those above the snow line, and another 5,000 will be distributed by Dec. 12. Jan Vandemoortele, the U.N.'s top aid coordinator in Pakistan, acknowledged a "colossal job" remains. "The first snowfall last week gave us a taste of what the future will be," he said in Islamabad. "The situation remains very difficult." Vandemoortele said many villagers are choosing to stay put despite the hardships. But he added that as the weather deteriorates, the number of people flowing into camps is expected to grow. "We remain on a knife's edge," he said. "It may get worse before it gets better."Caption:  photoRoshan Mughal / The Associated Press : Kashmiri earthquake survivors gather around a fire to warm themselves Friday in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan.
