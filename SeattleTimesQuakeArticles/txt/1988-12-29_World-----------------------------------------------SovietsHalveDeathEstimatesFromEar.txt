Soviet officials indicated today that the final death toll from the Armenian earthquake will be about half of the previous estimate of 55,000 people.         Yuri Chaplygin, a spokesman for the Soviet cabinet, said 24,854 people were confirmed dead as of yesterday.         Two deputy Armenian premiers, Yuri Hojamiryan and Vardges Artsruny, estimated that just 100-150 more bodies remain buried under the rubble of the Dec. 7 earthquake that devastated northwestern Armenia.         Estimates of the death toll have varied widely. Initially, Soviet officials estimated 40,000-45,000 died, while an Armenian official said 100,000 were feared dead. On Dec. 13, a Foreign Ministry spokesman gave a figure of 55,000.    JUSTICE CHIEF ADMITS TIES TO STOCK SCANDAL    TOKYO         Japan's new justice minister today rejected calls for his resignation after admitting he received donations from a company at the center of a stock-profiteering scandal that reaches deep into Japanese politics.         Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita appointed Takashi Hasegawa to the post two days ago with a mandate to probe the property company Recruit for suspected bribery.         Hasegawa claimed he learned only yesterday that his personal political organization had received contributions from Recruit of about $320 a month since 1976.         The Recruit  scandal has led to the resignations of 17 prominent business and political officials.    CHINESE MAY PUNISH AFRICAN STUDENTS    NANJING, China         Chinese officials said today they probably would punish at least seven African students for a brawl with Chinese workers, students and teachers that set off days of anti-black demonstrations.         They said no Chinese students would be punished for participating in the clash and subsequent demonstrations, or for sacking the rooms of some African students.         ``We know who the Africans are that carried out the beating,'' said Yang Ruiju, president of Hehai University, where the clash took place. ``The African students did this in a planned way.''         But the Chinese students ``demonstrated out of anger. They didn't hurt anybody, so none of them will be punished,'' Yang said in an interview.    --------------------------------------    NATION    --------------------------------------    FIVE PEOPLE INJURED IN HOLLYWOOD BLAZE    LOS ANGELES         Firefighters rescued more than a dozen people from a 15-story Hollywood office building, many of whom huddled on the roof in near-freezing weather after a blaze broke out on the ninth floor.
