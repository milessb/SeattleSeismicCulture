SANTIAGO, Chile (UPI) _ A powerful earthquake that rumbled through portions of central Chile _ where a major tremor struck last month _ shook buildings, knocked out power and sent panicked residents fleeing into the streets        A 50-year-old man died of a heart attack, and hospitals treated dozens of cases of hysteria caused by last night's earthquake, which registered 7.2 on the Richter scale, compared with last month's quake's reading of 7.7. No other casualties were reported.        Electrical power and telephone lines were reported cut in several places, and dozens of abandoned structures that were weakened by Chile's worst earthquake in 25 years, on March 3, collapsed under the new strain.        The tremor, which lasted more than a minute, was felt throughout a 1,000-mile region that was struck last month's quake, in which 177 people died and 2,000 were injured.        More than 500 aftershocks have shaken central Chile since the March quake, which was caused by the Nazca Plate under the Pacific Ocean moving under the South American continental plate.
