MEXICO CITY - A strong earthquake shook Mexico's Pacific Coast this morning, killing at least 31 people and injuring dozens in southern Jalisco state. High-rise buildings swayed crazily in Mexico City, frightening people into the streets    The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 7.5, was the second powerful tremor to hit Mexico in a month. It was felt as far north as Dallas and Oklahoma City.    Jalisco state spokeswoman Claudio Villalobos said 14 dead and at least 80 injured were reported from the two small towns of Tenamaxtlan and Ameca, near the Pacific Coast. Both towns were isolated by rockslides and collapsed bridges, and telephone service and power were reported out.    Eight people died in the small town of Cihuatlan, about 18 miles from Manzanillo, Colima state spokesman Mario Cardenas said.    Manzanillo's 12-story Hotel Real collapsed, and officials said an unknown number of people were trapped. Rescue workers were found three unidentified bodies by early afternoon.    President Ernesto Zedillo declared the Manzanillo zone a disaster area.    Four more were reported killed in La Huerta, a small town in the hardest-hit area, and two more died in Uruapan, further inland in Guanajuato state. Those reports could not be confirmed.    The epicenter was located three miles off the Pacific Coast between the states of Colima and Jalisco, the National Seismological Service said. The quake struck at 9:37 a.m., lasted about two minutes and was followed by two aftershocks.
