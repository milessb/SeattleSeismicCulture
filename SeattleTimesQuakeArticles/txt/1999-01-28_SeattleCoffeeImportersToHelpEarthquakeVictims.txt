COLOMBIA PROVIDES several local retail companies with beans. Crops are not expected to be affected.      The earthquake that thundered through Colombia this week isn't expected to wreak much of an impact on the country's coffee production, industry officials and several Seattle coffee companies said.     Still, Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks and Caffe Appassionato - all based in Seattle - said they are looking for ways to help victims of the quake, which has killed 700 people and left  200,000 homeless in Colombia, the world's second-largest coffee exporter.     Jim Clarke, president of Seattle Coffee, whose brands include Seattle's Best Coffee and Torrefazione Italia, said the company is watching the situation closely. But so far, the quake hasn't had an impact on the company's coffee supply.     "Really, we aren't feeling any effect," Clarke said. "The areas where we're getting most of our coffee are about 200 miles from the epicenter."      Clarke said the company, which gets up to 30 percent of its coffee from Colombia, will have Colombian Relief Day tomorrow, collecting donations from employees that will be matched by the company and then given to the Red Cross for relief efforts.     Tucker McHugh, executive vice president of Caffe Appassionato, said he's contacted several Northwest coffee companies about organizing a joint relief effort for Colombian victims. McHugh said about 40 percent of the coffee his company sells comes from Colombia.     McHugh said he's talked with a coffee broker in Colombia who reported "quite a bit of devastation" but added that the quake was unlikely to have a major impact on the world's coffee markets.        Starbucks  said yesterday it has plans to assist quake victims, though no specific efforts had been drawn up yet. "We're evaluating it and trying to contact our counterparts there," Starbucks spokeswoman Helen Chung said.       Industry officials said Colombia's coffee crops are basically intact, though there could be interruptions at some processing plants where beans are extracted from their shells before drying.     The quake damaged processing plants in much of Colombia's coffee belt, which could make it difficult to maintain Colombia's standards for a high-quality product.    "The risk is that the coffee not be of a quality that distinguishes Colombia," said Mario Gomez Estrada, a member of the National Committee of Coffee Growers.    For quality purposes,  beans must be processed the same day they are picked. With so many damaged plants, this process will likely be disrupted.    Colombia  accounts for 14 percent of world coffee exports. Only Brazil produces more. Nearly half of the 2.2 million acres dedicated to coffee in Columbia are in the five states hit by Monday's quake.
