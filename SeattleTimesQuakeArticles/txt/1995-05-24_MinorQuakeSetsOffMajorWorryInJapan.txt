TOKYO - Centered safely offshore, the quake warranted only a sentence or two on the late-night TV news. But in scientific circles, its aftershocks are reverberating.    Four months after Japan's sixth-largest city, Kobe, was devastated by a powerful quake, researchers are wondering whether signs point to an even bigger jolt in store for Tokyo.    The quake in question was felt throughout central Japan on the night of April 18.    No damage or injuries were reported, and the quake was quickly forgotten in the din of news about the doomsday cult and the rising yen.    But a closer look has experts worried. The cause for concern: The epicenter was in one of the world's most closely watched areas of potential seismic disaster, the Suruga Trough.    "To researchers, it was a very important event," said Katsuhiko Ishibashi, the chief seismologist at Japan's International Institute of Seismology and Earthquake Engineering.    With an estimated magnitude of 5.1, the quake was more than 100 times stronger than any other quake from a similar depth - about 12 miles - from the trough this year.    "It was an important indicator that a major quake could occur," Ishibashi said. "It is reckless to use the word omen, but I think the two are certainly linked."     Japan spent roughly $115 million on earthquake prediction last year. Since the Jan. 17 quake in Kobe, which killed more than 5,500 people, the government has ordered an even more intense effort.    Most scientists were taken by surprise by the intensity of the Kobe tremor, which had a magnitude of 7.2.         The Suruga Trough is closely monitored in Japan  because it has been the source of devastating earthquakes roughly every 100 years since 1498.     Even more disconcerting is historical evidence that a massive quake in the trough could set off a series of seismic events nearby, possibly even directly under Tokyo.    The Suruga Trough is an ocean-floor ravine created by the convergence of two tectonic plates - the giant slabs of rock that move across the earth's crust.    The meeting of the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate draws a line through Suruga Bay and runs on for an undetermined length inland. The Philippine Plate is forced underneath, pulling the Eurasian Plate down with itCaption:  MAPKNIGHT-RIDDER NEWSPAPER: JAPAN: COLLISION ZONE (MAP NOT AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY)
