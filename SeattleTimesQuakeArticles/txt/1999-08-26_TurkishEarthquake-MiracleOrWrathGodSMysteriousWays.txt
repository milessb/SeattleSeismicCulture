We're a funny lot.     A 4-year-old boy is found alive ("Boy lives 6 days in rubble," Page 1, Aug. 23) after spending 146 hours under rubble, and we call it "a miracle of God" that he survived.     And yet, thousands more died. "The official casualty count crept higher today to 12,134 dead and 33,384 injured. Some politicians and relief leaders have estimated as many as 40,000 people may have perished and believe thousands of bodies are still entombed by rubble."      Final score: miracle of God saves one, wrath of God takes 40,000. Steve Isaacson Seattle
