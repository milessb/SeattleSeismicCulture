JAKARTA, Indonesia - The death toll from a powerful earthquake in eastern Indonesia has reached 1,100, a government official said today.    A spokesman for the governor of East Nusa Tenggara province said the deaths were scattered throughout the island of Flores. Many others were injured, he said.    Hendrik Nai, a spokesman for the rescue teams, said bad communications were hampering the gathering of information from some parts of the island, which is about 1,000 miles east of Jakarta.    Indonesian officials measured the quake at 6.8 on the Richter scale. The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., measured it at 7.5 on the Richter scale.    J. Gadidjou, a spokesman for the province's governor, said ships were bringing volunteers, food and medicine from nearby towns to the damaged areas.    Nai said about 80 percent of the buildings in Maumere, in the northern part of Flores, were destroyed in the quake. Entire villages in coastal areas were wiped out by waves triggered by the quake, he said. The waves were as high as 80 feet and swept as far as 1,000 feet inland, he said.    The quake destroyed government buildings, schools, mosques, churches and shops in the towns of Maumere and Larantuka in the eastern part of the island.    Aftershocks spaced about five minutes apart continued to jolt the island until about midnight last night, further hampering rescue work, Nai said.    Most people remained away from their houses, many of which were in danger of collapsing. They spent the night outside with no tents in a tropical rainstorm.    The quake was centered about 19 miles southwest of Maumere, a coastal town with a population of 40,000 people, officials said.
