MEXICO CITY _ The angry woman from the United States with the bouffant hairdo, the standard-issue polyester pantsuit and sensible shoes had me cornered in the lobby of our hotel.        ``Why do you all journalists lie so much?'' she asked in a soft Tennessee drawl. ``You're saying that Mexico City was completely destroyed by the earthquake. But our tour just came back from the Aztec pyramids and there wasn't even one itty bitty piece of broken glass.''        Exhausted and not a little depressed after hours of looking at mangled bodies and buildings, I was at first inclined to inform the pesky woman that the Aztecs never had any glass.        I didn't. Instead, I told her I knew of no colleagues reporting that the entire city was flattened, and that in any case the Sept. 19 quake had surely wrought more havoc than she could have seen in her day's tour.        But her insistent questions stayed with me as I and six other Miami Herald reporters and photographers tried to record the extent of the damage and suffering.        The quake was unquestionably disastrous _ between 4,000 and 6,000 dead, about 700 buildings collapsed into what looked like stacks of pancakes, and a government virtually crippled by the destruction of several of its key offices.        But the damage could seem less severe if examined from another angle. The dead were a tiny fraction of Mexico City's 18 million people. The buildings damaged and the area affected amounted to only a tiny percent of the city's total.        After having read The Miami Herald, The New York Times and The Dallas Morning News for the days following the quake _ and having watched a few U.S. television reports from my cable-equipped hotel room _ I believe most reports of the disaster projected a correct balance.        Sure, there were errors.        The Herald published one story that referred to collapsed ``skyscrapers.'' Mexico has only two skyscrapers, and both still stand.        One television correspondent said the famed statue of a golden angel at the corner of El Paseo de la Reforma and Avenida Insurgentes ``stood alone, surrounded by devastation.'' I stood on that corner, and could not see one single destroyed building.        Almost all journalists appeared to give U.S. Ambassador John Gavin too much credence after he took a quick helicopter tour of the damaged area and pronounced the death toll was 10,000, perhaps double that, perhaps triple.        But these failings were not serious enough to overturn the thrust of most of the stories, pointing out that while the death toll was high and the destruction massive, most of the city remained on its feet.        And yet the impression persists that journalists painted a picture of city-wide devastation. There are two factors that may account for this, the first being what could be called the ``Third World disaster syndrome.''        Let's say it was reported that an earthquake had struck Lima, Peru, and killed 6,000 people. I would be willing to bet that the average North American, knowing little about Lima itself but mindful of past disasters that have flattened other Latin American capitals, would form an image in his mind of complete devastation.        Now say it was reported that another tremor had struck Washington, D.C., and also killed 6,000 people. The same average American, knowing something about Washington's size and style of construction, would immediately realize that only parts of the capital were damaged.        The second factor was the earthquake's interruption of all international telephone and Telex circuits out of Mexico City, blocking journalists in the capital from filing their firsthand accounts of the damage for at least 12 hours.        Instead, what the world first heard, saw and read were reports from tourists who left Mexico City just after the earthquake and from ham radio operators passing on personal accounts of the destruction.        This problem was compounded by the fact that the first pictures of quake damage received in the United States, showing destroyed building after destroyed building, were obtained by eavesdropping on a Mexican television satellite _ and often lacked the words of an announcer that could have clarified the extent of the damage.        The Mexican television crews were too busy filming the mayhem: the limp bodies of babies being pulled from the ruins of a hospital's maternity ward; the 14-story apartment building, once home to 1,300 people, now a 40-foot pile of rubble; the bodies, stacked like cordwood in a baseball outfield and covered with bags of party ice to keep them from decomposing.        I can't blame them, or anyone else, for reporting that horror.
