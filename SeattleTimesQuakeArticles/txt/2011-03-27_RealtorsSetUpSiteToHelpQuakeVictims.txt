In the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan, the Seattle King County Realtors has launched an online campaign to raise money to help victims get housing. "Our members have deep ties to Japan so we are keenly aware of the devastation and dire need for shelter," said Kristen Greenlaw, local Realtors president.
