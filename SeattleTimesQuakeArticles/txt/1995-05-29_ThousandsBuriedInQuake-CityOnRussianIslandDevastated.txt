MOSCOW - A powerful earthquake rocked an island off Russia's Pacific coast yesterday, flattening a remote oil-producing town and burying as many as 2,500 residents.    Rescue workers reported hearing moans from under the rubble in the town of Neftegorsk, which bore the brunt of the 7.5-magnitude quake that belted Sakhalin Island while most residents slept.      The ITAR-Tass news agency reported today that 300 people were confirmed killed in the quake, with the same number hospitalized. The report could not be independently verified. The casualty toll was expected to rise as rescue teams combed the remote site.    "I won't speculate on how many dead or fatally injured people may still be lying under the rubble," Lt. Col. Alexander Mikheyev said from Yuzhno Sakhalinsk, the island's capital.     The first local television footage in Neftegorsk showed rescue workers overwhelmed, pulling victims out by their limbs from beneath concrete slabs.     There was no sign yet of a coordinated relief operation, nor of medical staffs or medical supplies.     In one grim sequence, human limbs protruded from the debris, moving slowly. No one appeared to be trying to help.   By early today, rescuers had recovered 39 bodies from Neftegorsk and taken 144 people to the hospital, according to Russia's Ministry for Emergency Situations.    Eleonora Budrina, a ministry spokeswoman, said 2,500 people were unaccounted for and many were feared dead or injured.      The quake, which struck at 1:03 a.m. Sunday local time, was centered just offshore near its thinly populated northern tip. Neftegorsk, population 3,500 and located 40 miles northwest of the epicenter, was destroyed. Other villages were damaged.    The quake also fractured a 60-mile stretch of an oil pipeline leading north from Neftegorsk to the town of Okha.        As aftershocks of up to magnitude 3.0 jolted the island, rescue teams throughout eastern Russia rushed to Sakhalin. But heavy fog reportedly prevented some of the 18 aircraft from landing. First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg  Soskovets, who flew to Sakhalin last night, said the cash-strapped central government had allocated 30 billion rubles ($5.9 million) for relief.    Sakhalin Island, 4,000 miles east of Moscow, is rich in oil, gas, coal, timber and fish.     Strong ties exist between the Northwest and Sakhalin Island. Business and political leaders in both regions have worked to promote trade, and several Northwest companies have been positioning themselves to participate in widely anticipated offshore oil and gas development.   Efforts to establish a link between the regions began even before the breakup of the Soviet Union; the first U.S.-Soviet business venture was established in 1975 between a Northwest fish-processing company and a Sakhalin Island fishing operation.
