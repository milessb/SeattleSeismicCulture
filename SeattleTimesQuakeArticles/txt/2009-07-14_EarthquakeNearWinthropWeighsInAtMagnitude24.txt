It was located about two miles south of Winthrop and six miles north-northwest of Twisp. "We only got a couple of calls when it happened, and people were saying they heard a loud bang and thought something had crashed," said an Okanogan County sheriff's dispatcher. "We later learned from the radio that it was an earthquake. Another dispatcher told me the bang noise was actually the earth moving." She said no damage was reported.
