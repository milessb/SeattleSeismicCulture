LOS ANGELES _ Part of an earthquake-damaged apartment house that had been declared partially safe by city inspectors collapsed during the weekend, but the three families who were living there escaped unhurt, police said        ``They heard a creaking inside and the house started to sway and they got out of there as quickly as they could,'' Sgt. John Vanelli said yesterday. ``Right after that, the house started to collapse.''        The two-story apartment complex in the Boyle Heights area of East Los Angeles remained intact, but its middle sagged and the walls bulged after the building slid off its foundation shortly after midnight, Vanelli said.        Two of the four units in the building had been declared unsafe after an earthquake shook the area Oct. 1, Vanelli said.Caption:  PHOTOUPI: LUIS LUNA WAS LIVING IN THE PART OF THIS APARTMENT BUILDING THAT HAD BEEN DECLARED SAFE AFTER THE OCT. 1 EARTHQUAKE IN LOS ANGELES.
