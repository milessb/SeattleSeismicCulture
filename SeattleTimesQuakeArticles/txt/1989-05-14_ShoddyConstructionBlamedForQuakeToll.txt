SHODDY CONSTRUCTION BLAMED FOR QUAKE TOLL    --  MOSCOW        A Politburo commission blamed most of the 25,000 deaths in Armenia's earthquake on shoddy construction and turned its findings over to prosecutors to file criminal charges, Tass said yesterday        ``The catastrophic consequences of the earthquake in Armenia are explained above all by the low quality of the building and assembly work, by the inadmissible violation of design norms and the strength of underground tremors,'' the official news agency reported.        The report ended an investigation that began immediately after the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale.
