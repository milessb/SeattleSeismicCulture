z   A moderate earthquake struck central Alaska yesterday. There were no immediate reports of damage or injury.     The temblor registered a preliminary magnitude of 3 on the Richter scale and was centered about 25 miles northwest of Fairbanks, said seismologist Doug Christensen at the Alaska Earthquake Information Center in Fairbanks.     The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs.     An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in a local area, 4 can cause moderate damage, 5 considerable damage and 6 can be severe.
