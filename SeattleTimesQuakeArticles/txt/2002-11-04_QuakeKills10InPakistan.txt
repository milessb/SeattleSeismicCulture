ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- A magnitude-4.5 earthquake jolted northern Pakistan yesterday, killing at least 10 people and injuring 48, many of them critically, officials said. The quake hit near Gilgit, about 125 miles north of Islamabad, said Chaudhry Mehmood Arif, an official in the Seismic Center in the northwestern city of Peshawar. It was one of a series of temblors that rumbled through northern Pakistan over three days, shaking the foundations of fragile mud homes that cling to mountainsides. Four villages, with a total population of 1,500, were most affected by the tremors. Several homes were destroyed, and 10 bodies were found in the rubble. The Pakistan military took many of the injured out by helicopter after landslides blocked the only road leading to the quake site. The quake also damaged a portion of the northern highway that runs the length of Pakistan to China. The remoteness of the region makes it impossible to know quickly the full extent of the damage. But the area is sparsely populated. The government sent food and tents to the region.       Information from Reuters is included in this report.
