RENTON    How much sewage flows from East King County? Well, too much for an old pipeline through downtown Renton.    The pipe was damaged in an earthquake in 1965, and portions were patched, but some capacity was lost. And regional growth has increased the volume. So the county plans a new bypass pipe - 6 feet in diameter - around the quake-damaged area.     Crews will tunnel next year for five blocks beneath Morris Avenue South and Houser Way South, 30 feet below the surface.     An open house and public meeting will be at 6 tonight on the seventh floor of Renton City  Hall.
