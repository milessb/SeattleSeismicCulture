MEXICO CITY _ Mexico City is a city in trouble. And not just because of yesterday's earthquake.          Its huge population and rapid growth have overwhelmed efforts to provide basic services.         An estimated 17 million people, 20 percent of the country's population, live in the 586-square-mile Mexico City metropolitan area.          The city's population is higher than that of many countries, including Australia, which is more than 5,000 times as large in area. Mexico City's population is projected to reach 18.1 million this year, making it the largest metropolitan area in the world.        It is a teeming, overcrowded, polluted urban maze, where daily life is a physical and emotional strain. And as the population continues to grow at an annual rate of 5 percent, those problems will be exacerbated.        Mexico City's problems are worsened by its location _ on a dry, dusty lake bed in a valley 7,400 feet high. Surrounded by mountains and volcanoes, smog collects and remains trapped in the valley.        Breathing Mexico City's air, according to the National Autonomous University of Mexico, is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. The leading cause of death in the nation _ 13.4 percent _ is respiratory ailments.        At a mile-and-a-half above sea level, Mexico City is also far from water supplies, and as more and more subterranean water is withdrawn, the city is gradually sinking _ 35 feet in the past 70 years.        Besides coping with environmental hazards, many Mexico City residents lack basic services. An estimated 4 million households lack bathrooms and at least 1.2 million people do not have normal water service.
