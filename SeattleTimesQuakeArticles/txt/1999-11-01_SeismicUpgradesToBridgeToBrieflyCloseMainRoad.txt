KIRKLAND      One of the main routes into Kirkland is expected to be closed over two weekend nights in the next few months.     The closure is planned on Central Way sometime between late December and February as seismic upgrades are made on a bridge that crosses railroad tracks west of Interstate 405. Central Way is the main road from I-405 to downtown Kirkland.     The project is expected to cost $114,000. The closures would be from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. on two consecutive weekend nights.
