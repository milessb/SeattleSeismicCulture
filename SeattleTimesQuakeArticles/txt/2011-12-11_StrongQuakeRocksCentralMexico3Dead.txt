MEXICO CITY â€” A 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck in Mexico's western Guerrero state Saturday night, shaking buildings and causing panic in the nation's capital and the Pacific resort of Acapulco. Officials said at least three people died, but there were no reports of widespread damage. The U.S. Geological Service initially estimated the quake at magnitude 6.8, but downgraded it to 6.7 and then 6.5. A quake of that magnitude is capable of causing severe damage, although the depth of this temblor lessened its impact. The USGS said the quake occurred at a depth of 40.3 miles. It was centered about 103 miles south-southwest of Mexico City. Mexico's Interior Department said the quake was felt in parts of nine states. Humberto Calvo, undersecretary of Guerrero's Civil Protection agency, said three deaths had been reported in the state. He said one man was killed when a house's roof collapsed in Iguala, a second died in the small town of Ixcateopan and the driver of a cargo truck was killed by rocks that fell on the vehicle while traveling on a toll highway linking Acapulco with Mexico City. Calvo said a secondary highway between the two cities was blocked in two places by rockslides. High-rises swayed in the center of Mexico City for more than a minute. Mexico City's mayor, Marcelo Ebrard, reported by Twitter that no major damage had been reported. He said power failed in some parts of the city. People in one part of Mexico City's upscale Condesa neighborhood ran out of their houses and gathered in the streets, hugging each as some shook and wept.
