Apparently Times reader Robert Hayes (Letters, Feb. 25) is not paying enough taxes to suit him. He wants to tear down the "ugly, noisy, stale" Alaskan Way viaduct, and replace it with a new tunnel under the city. He doesn't say whether the proposed tunnel will also be "ugly, noisy and stale" (his words) but I've never seen one that was not. And expensive, too     Every time California has an earthquake, the local Chicken Littles come out clucking about rebuilding almost every structure in Seattle. I have lived through every earthquake in this area since the '40s, and our buildings look good to me.     Chicken Littles, back in your pens! R.W. Stommel Seattl
