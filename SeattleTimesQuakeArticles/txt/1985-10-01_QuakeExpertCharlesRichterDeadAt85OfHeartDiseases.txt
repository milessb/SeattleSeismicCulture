PASADENA, Calif. (UPI) _ Dr. Charles Richter, whose development of the earthquake scale that bears his name made him the world's best-known quake expert, is dead of heart disease. He was 85.        Richter died yesterday at a convalescent home where he had lived for the last year.        As a young research assistant at California Institute of Technology in the early 1930s, he collaborated with the head of the seismology laboratory, Beno Gutenberg, to devise a method of measuring the relative strengths of earthquakes.        Richter taught at Caltech from 1937 until his retirement in 1970.        The Richter scale is a logarithmic measure that expresses the magnitude of a quake in terms of the energy dissipated in it. A magnitude 1.5 is the smallest quake that can be felt; a 4.5 will cause slight damage in a populated area, and an 8.5 is a devastating quake.        In addition to developing his scale, Richter mapped out quake-prone areas of the United States where faults in the Earth's surface exist.        He helped establish a seismological reporting network at Caltech that studies earthquakes around the world.
