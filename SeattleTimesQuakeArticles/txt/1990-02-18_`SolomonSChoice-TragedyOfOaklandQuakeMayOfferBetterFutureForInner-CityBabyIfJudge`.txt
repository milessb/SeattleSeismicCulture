OAKLAND, Calif. - Jimmy Brown has chubby cheeks and two new teeth, and last week he got his first vaccination.        He knows how to shake his head ``no'' and wave goodbye and he leaves sticky fingerprints on the television screen.        In these and other ways, Jimmy Brown is a typical 8-month-old baby.        But Jimmy, a child of the inner city and its disintegrating families, has already been touched by more suffering than most people know in a lifetime.        Jimmy was orphaned in the Oct. 17 earthquake, when the Nimitz Freeway collapsed, crushing his teen-age parents.        Now he is at the heart of a custody dispute between two warring grandparents, each charging that the other is unfit to raise the child and thus collect at least $100,000 in compensation due from the state.        Judge Roderic Duncan of Alameda County Superior Court told the quarrelsome grandparents last week that he might disqualify both of them from raising the child and ``look further down the family tree.''        While the judge considers what is best for Jimmy, the California Board of Control, which administers claims to victims and survivors of the highway collapse, is holding up compensation.        On the one hand, Duncan says, he is uneasy about a 35-year-old maternal grandmother who is raising her own children on welfare and has been accused of entertaining drug addicts in her home.        On the other hand, he is wary about a 37-year-old paternal grandfather who served time in prison for grand theft.        Jimmy's genealogy, as laid out in court documents and in interviews with family members and their lawyers, is a microcosm of today's urban underclass.        For generations, the women on both sides of the family, beginning as teen-agers, have borne children out of wedlock. The men have spent more time in jail than out.        A few of the youngsters have gone to school and found jobs. The rest have joined their parents on welfare lines or added their names to police blotters.        As Duncan sees it, Jimmy may be luckier than most, despite the terrible loss of his parents' death.        The money he is entitled to, the judge says, could reverse the downward spiral that might otherwise be his lot in life.        ``But not if I do the knee-jerk thing,'' Duncan adds, meaning automatically giving the child to one of his grandparents.        Each grandparent says the other wants Jimmy only for the money, charges that are heatedly denied.         The compensation, which will be placed in trust, comes under state legislation passed  to compensate those who lost relatives in the freeway collapse. The law automatically entitles  minor children to $50,000 for each parent lost.        State claims adjusters may award additional money for individual family hardships. Lawyers on both sides say that in Jimmy's case total compensation could reach a quarter-million dollars.        As with so many inner-city families, Jimmy's has an elderly matriarch, Louise Brown, who raised her own 10 children in her Oakland home, some of her children's children and a few neighborhood children besides.        Louise Brown is Jimmy's great-grandmother, the grandmother of James Brown III, who died on the Nimitz with his girlfriend, Michelle Marie Richard.          Louise Brown's son, James II, is one of the baby's grandparents pressing a custody claim; the other is Anita Williams, Richard's mother.        ``I never have said this before, but I'm willing to take that baby if my record is cleaner than the rest,'' says Louise Brown, who is 65. ``I'll hire somebody to help me if I get too tired.''        Louise Brown, in many ways, is the voice of reason in this noisy squabble.        She is largely without illusion about the men in her family. Her son, James Brown II, was ``the best child I had in terms of kindness,'' she says, ``until drugs overpowered the good things'' and he wound up in jail.        ``But everybody has bad history, and that doesn't mean they're still that way.''        In recent months, James II has started a landscaping company , enrolled in an evangelical school and married his longtime companion, Carolyn. The baby was with Carolyn at the time of the earthquake.        Louise Brown's grandson, James III, also had his share of troubles, long before his fateful car trip on Oct. 17 with Richard, to go fishing off the Berkeley pier.        James III's parents were 15 when he was born and split up soon afterward.        His mother's next companion was a bully, and his father was in and out of jail, so James III came to live with his grandmother. By his 19th birthday, the young man had fathered several children, and was living with Michelle, Jimmy's mother.        In the days after the earthquake, the two families that hardly knew each other locked horns.        The joint funeral was an ugly occasion for argument: Who would pay for the flowers? Who owned the car? Who would get the family photographs from James III's and Michelle's apartment?        The baby was passed back and forth, with each side threatening not to let the other see Jimmy.        Jimmy lives with Williams for now, with two days a week at James II's and Carolyn Brown's and lots of visits to his great-grandmother.        Judge Duncan says he does not intend to hurry his decision or succumb to the fevered importunings of either party, or to the gaggle of lawyers.        Asked if he feels like King Solomon, about to cut a baby in two, Duncan pauses deliberately.        ``No,'' he replies. ``Although this is one of those wonderful opportunities to do the right thing, which is why you decide you want to be a judge.'
