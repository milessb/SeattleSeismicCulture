PADANG, Indonesia â€” A 6.6-magnitude temblor hit the Sumatra coast today, triggering the latest tsunami warning, the local meteorological agency said. However, the U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was probably not powerful enough to create a deadly tsunami. "This earthquake isn't big enough," said geophysicist Randy Baldwin. "Generally it needs to be over 7.2 [magnitude]." Officials at Indonesia's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency said a tsunami alert had been issued. Smaller waves were recorded farther down the coast.
