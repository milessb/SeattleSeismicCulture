A moderate earthquake struck yesterday off the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.        The tremor was recorded at a preliminary magnitude of 5.8 on the Richter Scale, Don Finley of the Reston, Va., office said.        U.S. Geological Survey monitors in Golden, Colo., said the tremor was centered in the Pacific Ocean, about 70 miles off the island of Adak in the Aleutians. The earthquake was felt on Adak and Atka islands, Finley said.         There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.        The Richter Scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake. A quake measuring 5 on the scale can cause considerable damage.
