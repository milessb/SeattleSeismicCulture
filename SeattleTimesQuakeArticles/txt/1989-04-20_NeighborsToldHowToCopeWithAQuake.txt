Using symbols that everyone can recognize - the American flag and the colors red, yellow and green - two Kingsgate women have started a self-help program to gear neighborhoods to respond to an earthquake         Bev Carter and Cathy Warriner don't wonder whether an earthquake will strike this area: They assume that eventually one will and that it may be a major one. They also believe most people won't be ready for it, especially in the neighborhoods.         The idea of a training program  came to Carter after she saw a television documentary two years ago about earthquakes in the Puget Sound area and found there wasn't much preparation. It became clear to her that people would be on their own for the first few days.         ``I was surprised to find out there was no evacuation plans for the schools,'' Carter said. ``What would happen to the children when they got home? If their parents aren't there or they are killed or injured, what happens to the children?         ``I'm the only mother on this block who is home during the day. What will happen to these kids if something happens during the day?''         With that in mind, Carter started a nonprofit group called Mothers for HELP (Help Everyone Learn Preparedness). Its basic goal is to make sure people can survive for at least three days without any outside help.         The program is patterned after the Block Watch program set up to control neighborhood crime. Each neighborhood would be organized around the local fire station, with a community coordinator from HELP reporting to the station. In turn, each neighborhood would have a chairman and each block would be divided into groups of 10 families.         Each of the 10 families would be responsible for some emergency item, such as medical supplies, transportation or water. Each family would also have enough supplies on hand to take care of its needs for three days.         Carter said the neighborhood plan could be adapted to any size, including large apartment complexes and businesses.         The families would also have signal ribbons, colored red, yellow and green, which would tell rescuers the status of the home. A red ribbon hanging on the door or in front of the house would mean there was a life-threatening problem in the house and help was needed immediately. A yellow ribbon would signal that help was needed but that the situation wasn't life-threatening. A green ribbon would mean the family was safe or the home had been evacuated.         An American flag hanging on a front door would signify that the resident was the block captain.         Without such signals, ``a lot of time would be spent by rescuers looking for someone in a collapsed home when they have already left the scene,'' Carter said.         ``The medics say they won't have time to stop at every house looking for people,'' Warriner said.         Carter, who is president of the group, and Warriner, who is vice president, say they are extending the program to schools and community groups. They will make a 20-minute presentation any time a group of 150 or more can be gathered. Each presentation includes a demonstration of what is needed to keep a family functioning for three days, how to organize a neighborhood and how the ribbon signal system works.
