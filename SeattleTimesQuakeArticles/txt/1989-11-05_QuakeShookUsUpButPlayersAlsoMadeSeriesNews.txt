SAN FRANCISCO - It was the World Series in which the fault lines got more attention than the box score lines.        It was the World Series that almost brought us the first appearance of that eagerly awaited baseball hero, Mr. November.        It was the World Series that finally ended a soap-opera season that wound its way from the pages of Penthouse magazine to the courtrooms of Ohio, from the Memorial Day retirement of a Hall of Fame third baseman to the tragic Labor Day weekend that felled an eloquent commissioner.        Yes, it was a World Series that could only have been played in the strange and unforgettable year of 1989 - the year the off-the-field headlines often made you forget the on-the-field heroics.        Yet it was still a Series and a season that produced baseball's most dominating champions since the Big Red Machine:        The '89 Oakland A's. They put on a show.        Injuries couldn't stop them. An earthquake couldn't stop them. The San Francisco Giants, couldn't stop them.        By the end, they couldn't even cross the Bay Bridge to win the Bay Bridge World Series. And that will forever symbolize the Series it took them 15 days to sweep.        Let us look back now one last time on that World Series - and the men who made it memorable in its own unique fashion:        --  DAVE STEWART. Four years ago, he was a mop-up man for the Philadelphia Phillies. Three years and five months ago, he was waiting in baseball's unemployment lines.        But in this bizarre October, he was the towering figure whose strength and presence went far beyond that little hill 60 feet from home plate.        He was the first pitcher in history to win two playoff games and two World Series games in the same year.        He was the first pitcher to win Games 1 and 3 of a World Series since Christy Mathewson in 1905. In fact, at one point, he had even won three of the last four games the A's had played.        And he and Mike Moore combined to make the A's the first team in nearly five decades (since the 1940 Reds) to win a World Series while getting all their wins from two starting pitchers.        He has been the best pitcher in baseball between 1987 and right this minute. And that has earned him zero Cy Young Awards.        But Dave Stewart walked away from this Series with a World Series MVP award. And he walked away, too, as the epitome of both class and compassion.        He grew up in Oakland in a neighborhood not far from the collapsed portion of the Nimitz Freeway. For nearly a week after that collapse, he could not sleep.        So night after night, he would rise from his bed after 2 a.m. and drive to that scene of devastation and despair. Then he would walk and he would look and he would offer words of encouragement to the rescue workers who needed help to go on.        He went on to pitch the game that brought this Series back to life. But on the night he won Game 3, he saluted the rescue workers and doctors as being the true, selfless heroes of this October.        ``That,'' said Dave Stewart, ``is what makes America great.''        True. But it also is men like Dave Stewart who make baseball a great part of that America.        --  RICKEY HENDERSON. October is money time. So October was Rickey Henderson's time.        He put that gas pedal to the floor in the first inning of the very first playoff game. And over the next four weeks, the only time he hit the brakes was the day he seemed to be the only man in America who didn't know the A's were planning to work out after the earthquake.        He had a World Series to win. He had the free-agent gravy train to ride. What more motivation did he need than that? And as we all know now, when Rickey Henderson is motivated, the rest of baseball seems powerless to stop him.        So he stole more bases in this postseason (11) than any player before him. And he had more hits in a four-game World Series (nine) than anyone in history except George Herman Ruth (who had 10 in 1928).        He hit .474 in the Series. He hit .442 in the postseason. In nine postseason games, he was on base a phenomenal 25 times and produced 20 runs.        ``He looks,'' said Giant Manager Roger Craig, ``like he can turn it on whenever he wants to.''        --  WILL CLARK. How long ago was that playoff grand slam that soared above the packed bleachers of Wrigley Field?        Was it really this month? Was it really this season?        ``Yeah, it seems like a long time ago,'' admitted Will Clark.        Well, it was. It was four weeks ago this Wednesday that this man, The Natural, hit the home run that launched the playoff series that elevated him securely into the ranks of the greatest players of his time.        It was going to be Will Clark's October then. Instead, his October dissolved into a losing battle with tonsilitis and an earthquake and the Oakland A's.        He drove in fewer runs in this World Series than Bill Bathe or Greg Litton. In fact, he drove in no runs at all.        So, ironically, if Will Clark is remembered for anything at all in this Series, it will be for landing on top of the commissioner of baseball while catching a foul ball.        ``Well, I couldn't think of a greater ballplayer to land right in my lap,'' said Fay Vincent, with proper admiration.        But even if the lightning bolts never flew from Will Clark's bat, he left thunderclaps behind him wherever he went. And now those thunderclaps just might follow him forever.        --  DON ROBINSON. Who summed up the Giants' World Series better than this guy?        First, he was the symbol of their battered starting rotation - a rotation that wound up with a World Series ERA of 11.77.        He went 33 days between starts. He wore a knee brace that looked like the earthquake-repair scaffolding. He lasted 1 inning in the one game he pitched. None of his fellow Giants starters made it past the fourth.        And was there any more typical example of that than the pitch he made to A's pitcher Mike Moore, the pitch Moore crushed to center field for the first hit by an American League pitcher since the Carter administration?        It was the wrong pitch to the wrong guy at the wrong time. But it was the way the Giants pitched all Series.        ``I'll see that fastball all winter,'' Roger Craig said.
