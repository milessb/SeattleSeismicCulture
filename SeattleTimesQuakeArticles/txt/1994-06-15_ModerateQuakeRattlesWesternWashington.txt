SEATTLE - A moderate earthquake shook Western Washington at 1:22 a.m. today, measuring 3.7 in magnitude and centered approximately 20 miles west of Bremerton.     The quake was widely felt, said Steve Malone, research professor at the University of Washington geophysics program. There were no reports of damage or injury.     "It was pretty deep, about 25 miles deep, which is deep enough that it's not likely to cause any damage even in the epicentral area," Malone said.
