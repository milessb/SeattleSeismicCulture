You may be eligible for a property-tax break if your property was damaged in last week's earthquake--and maybe even if it wasn't, King County Assessor Scott Noble says. State law provides for relief on 2001 taxes for damaged property and for property that suffered no damage but dropped by 20 percent or more in value as a result of the quake. Affected property owners can phone the Assessor's Office at 206-296-3920 or 206-296-5151 and ask for a form called the Taxpayer's Claim for Reduction of Assessment on Destroyed Property. The form can be downloaded fromwww.metrokc.gov/assessor/. Taxpayers have three years to apply for relief. The dollar value of any damage must be established by an appraiser from the Assessor's Office.
