EVEN as the dead still were being counted in the aftermath of the Mexican earthquake, emergency-services officials called the press to a meeting here last week to deliver a prediction that Puget Sound residents do not like to hear: This region is about due for another big quake of its own         While the timing of the news conference was a bit tacky _ to capitalize on human concerns over events in Mexico _ the session served as a useful reminder that most of us could be better prepared individually in case of natural disaster. A Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesman noted, for example, that citizens could not expect emergency-services workers to be available the instant an earthquake occurs.         In most cases, survivors would be on their own for as long as three days.         Longtime residents may remember that the most recent severe earthquake in this state _ a tremor that hit 6.5 on the Richter scale _ occurred in 1965. The record indicates quakes of that magnitude tend to occur at intervals of about 20 years.         Seismologists are working on ways to predict quakes, but it's still an inexact science. Chinese experts accurately forecast a major earthquake in 1975, thereby helping prevent heavy casualties. But two quakes the following year in Tangshan _ in which an estimated 800,000 perished _ came without warning.
