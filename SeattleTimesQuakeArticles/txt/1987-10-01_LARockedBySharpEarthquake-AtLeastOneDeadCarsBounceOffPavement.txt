A major earthquake struck Southern California this morning, collapsing at least one building, sending cars a foot off the ground and setting off landslides in the Los Angeles area. At least one person was killed        The quake was felt as far south as San Diego, north to Santa Barbara and as far east as Las Vegas.          One person was killed when a wall in a parking structure collapsed at California State University at Los Angeles, according to City Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells.        Mark Bennett, assistant chief of law enforcement for the California Emergency Services office, said the agency had an unconfirmed report of a second death, from electrocution.          ``We've had some reports of people suffering heart attacks,'' Wells added.         The first jolt was recorded at 7:42 a.m. PDT, when the city's freeways were jammed with commuters.        The quake, which registered 6.1 on the Richter scale, struck as bright sunshine bathed the city, according to Waverly Person, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center in Denver.        The state Emergency Services Office in Sacramento said the quake was centered nine miles south of Pasadena in the Montebello-Whittier area at the north end of the Elsinore Fault.         It was followed by at least 12 aftershocks measuring 3 or more on the Richter scale.        It was the strongest quake in the Los Angeles area since 1971, when the Sylmar quake in the San Fernando Valley, northwest of Los Angeles, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale. Sixty-four people were killed in that disaster.        This morning, broken glass from thousands of windows littered some streets and there were reports of landslides and one building fire. Hundreds of police patrolled the streets.        An air-traffic reporter for KNX radio, Judy Abe, said, ``All the traffic stopped in all the (freeway) lanes. Quite unusual.''        Drivers said the quake sent cars jumping a foot in the air. Branches of trees cracked and palm trees crashed to the ground.         Cable News Network reported the Burbank airport was closed.           At the City Hall emergency center in downtown Los Angeles, Lt. Larry Townsend said, ``All downtown buildings have been evacuated, including Parker Center, which is the police department. At the time of the earthquake, about 3,000 were evacuated from city-run buildings.''        ``We have no bodily injuries, but extensive structural damage,'' Townsend said. ``There are lots of cracks in buildings. The L.A. Times building had a big window that was shattered but no one was hit. There is glass everywhere.''        He said people were standing in huddles in the street.         Linnea Hunt-Stewart, a magazine editor who lives in Pasadena, said the quake felt as bad as the quake in 1971, but not rolling like that one.         ``This was a big boom, then massive shaking that felt like it lasted about 15 seconds,'' she said. ``There were at least six aftershocks; the first three were nearly as intense. They were all within a span of 20 minutes.         ``The dogs are going crazy, cabinet doors flung open, books are all over the floor, crockery is smashed and I can't call out.''        Lloyd Darrington, a spokesman for the California Emergency Services Office in Sacramento, said he had reports of ``one collapsed building in the Pasadena area, and there are several fires in the area.''         In West Los Angeles, Cheri Wilkinson, a paralegal, said, ``It was heavier than the quake in '71, more violent and jarring.'' Books fell off shelves there, too.         Damage still was being assessed this morning.         Radio station KNX reported that the California Department of Transportation has ordered the Santa Ana Freeway closed about 15 miles southeast of the city near Pico Rivera because of cracks in the 605-freeway overpass.          Power was knocked out in parts of the city and rock and dirt slides were reported. Boulders blocked part of Mulholland Drive in Hollywood.         CNN said at least one building collapsed in Pasadena, and some buildings in the Hollywood area, within miles of the epicenter, apparently were evacuated.          CNN also said there was a report, unconfirmed, that a fire of undetermined severity had broken out at UCLA.         Also there was a chemical spill at the University of Southern California.
