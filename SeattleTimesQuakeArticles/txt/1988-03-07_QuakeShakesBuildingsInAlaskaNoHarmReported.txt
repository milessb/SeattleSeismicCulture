ANCHORAGE _ Hundreds of people along Alaska's southern coasts returned to their homes yesterday after a major earthquake set buildings swaying in many Alaska communities and triggered a tsunami warning        The quake hit at 2:35 p.m. Seattle time  and was centered about 210 miles south of Cape Yakataga, near a region that has been a hotbed of earthquake activity in recent months. It had a magnitude of between 7.3 and 7.5 on the Richter scale.        There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.        The Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer ordered residents of low-lying coastal areas along the North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska to higher ground at 2:53 p.m. The warning was canceled at 4:02 p.m.        ``We had some minor activity in Sitka and Yakutat, but nothing threatening at all,'' said warning center spokesman Alec Medberry. ``It ranged from a few inches to a foot or two. It looks like possibly a foot and a half at Yakutat; much smaller at Sitka.''        A tsunami watch had been ordered for the remainder of Alaska and for Washington, Oregon and California.        In Kodiak, the tsunami warning sent hundreds of people to a high school on a hill. Police there said the only problem was a small traffic jam.        Seward officials had started moving people to schools on high ground, and in Yakutat, the nearest community to the earthquake center, about 150 people started moving toward high ground. At least one vessel left the community's harbor to ride out any wave in the deeper water of the open sea.        ``I just kept thinking it was going to be over and it wasn't,'' said Valdez emergency services dispatcher Susie Blackburn. ``It just rocked real good and real long.''        Cordova police Sgt. Fred Brady used a stopwatch to time the quake's duration at 55 seconds in his Gulf of Alaska coastal community where 1,100 people, about a third of the town, were told to go to higher ground.        ``Boy did we shake in our trailer,'' said Pearl Trick, while listening to the radio in Seward for word on whether she and her husband should grab the two kids and drive to higher ground.        Yakutat officials were reluctant to order an evacuation after it proved unnecessary after the last two strong quakes, said city manager Jim Filip.        A 7.0 magnitude quake occurred Nov. 16, followed by a 7.6 quake Nov. 30. Both occurred in the Gulf of Alaska, and both resulted in tsunami warnings and evacuations, but no tsunamis occurred.        Carte said yesterday's quake was about 100 miles south of the two November quakes and, although part of the same fault system, he said scientists had not expected such a strong quake to come from this southern edge of that fault system.        The 1964 ``Good Friday'' earthquake in Alaska measured 8.5 on the Richter scale and was centered in Prince William Sound. It generated large waves that devastated several coastal communities and killed 114 people as far south as Oregon and Hawaii.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.        An earthquake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A magnitude 7 quake is a major earthquake, capable of widespread damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake capable of tremendous damage.
