I support the Lake Washington School District capital-projects levy. Many maintenance and repair items will be funded if this levy passes, but none are more important than the earthquake upgrades the district plans     My children attend Redmond Elementary School, which opened in 1925. The levy would fund the necessary upgrades that would make our 70-year-old building safer in case of an earthquake.     Please join me in voting yes for the capital-projects levy.
