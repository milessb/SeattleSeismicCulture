You want to send money; relief agencies need it. But how do you know if the organization is legitimate or will use your money wisely? These tips can help. • Basic questions: What's the name and address of the charity? Is the charity registered or licensed? How much money goes toward programs? And in the case of paid fund-raisers, how much money do they keep and how much goes to the charity? • The Web site of the American Institute of Philanthropy, www.charitywatch.org, issues letter grades and gives details on about 500 charities nationwide. • The site www.guidestar.org doesn't evaluate charities, but it provides a database on about 1 million U.S. nonprofits. • The Better Business Bureau's wise-giving Web site, www.give.org, measures nonprofit agencies against 20 standards. The regional BBB offers more on local charities, online at www.thebbb.org. Or call 206-431-2222. • Click on "charities" at www.secstate.wa.gov to find out if a charity or fund-raiser is registered with the state as required by law.
