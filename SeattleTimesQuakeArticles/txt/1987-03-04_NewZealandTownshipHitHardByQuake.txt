AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The smell of rotting food rose from a heavily damaged town where more than 1,000 people abandoned their damaged homes as authorities worked to provide power and water to areas stricken by this week's major earthquake        Attention focused on the small township of Edgecumbe, which suffered the brunt of damage in the quake that struck coastal communities on the North Island of New Zealand Monday.        ``Unfortunately, the damage is far greater than was first thought,'' said Brian Guy, who is directing civil defense relief operations in Edgecumbe.        He said the community was still without power, water, gas and telephone services. The odor of rotting food and unflushed sewage was overpowering.        More than 1,000 residents, half the town's population, camped out for a second night for fear their quake-damaged homes would collapse.        Elsewhere in the Bay of Plenty region, things were slowly returning to normal.        Monday's temblor, measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale, was the strongest in New Zealand in 19 years. The government initially estimated damage at $8.4 million but said the figure could go higher.        More that 1,000 aftershocks were recorded, but officials said they were lessening in intensity.          Police said 25 people suffered injuries and two people were reported missing.        The acting chief of the Seismological Observatory in Wellington, the capital, meanwhile defended advice given to Bay of Plenty people just before the quake that there was no danger of a large tremor. A long series of minor shocks had been felt in the area last week.
