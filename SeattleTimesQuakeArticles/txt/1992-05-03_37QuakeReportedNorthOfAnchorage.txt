FAIRBANKS, Alaska A small earthquake measuring 3.7 on the Richter scale was reported Friday evening in central Alaska about 150 miles north of Anchorage, authorities said.     The quake was centered at the railway outpost of Hurricane on the Parks Highway between Anchorage and Fairbanks, said John Davies of the Alaska Earthquake Information Center in Fairbanks.    "It doesn't appear to have been felt by anyone so there are no reports of damage or injuries," he said. The quake was a deep one, centered about 50 miles underground, he said.    The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
