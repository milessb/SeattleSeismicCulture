Most Southern California homeowners are without coverage for damage related directly to yesterday's earthquake, greatly reducing insurance-industry exposure.    "About 75 percent of California home and business owners lack earthquake insurance, and that's a real tragedy," said Loretta Worters of the Insurance Information Institute.    The upshot is that many victims may face staggering repair bills.    There were no immediate estimates of the damage caused by the worst quake to hit the area in more than two decades, and there probably won't be any for several days, say Worters and other industry experts.
