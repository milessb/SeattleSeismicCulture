ENTIAT, Chelan County - A small earthquake delivered "a very quick jolt" to this Eastern Washington town yesterday morning but did no apparent damage.     The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 3.3, was centered about 3 miles north-northwest of Entiat, according to Bill Steele, a University of Washington seismologist in Seattle. Entiat is about 15 miles north of Wenatchee.     The school building was checked for damage, but none was found so classes for 400 students continued.
