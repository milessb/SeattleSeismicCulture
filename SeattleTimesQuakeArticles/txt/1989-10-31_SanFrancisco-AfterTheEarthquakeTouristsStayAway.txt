SAN FRANCISCO - It's a great time to be a tourist in San Francisco. There are no lines to get onto the cable cars. It's easy to get dinner reservations and Fisherman's Wharf, the city's most popular attraction, is largely deserted.        ``You could have set off a cannon in Macy's last week and it wouldn't have hit anyone,'' noted Dan Williams, a financial analyst in San Francisco.        The powerful Oct. 17 earthquake that rocked San Francisco, Oakland and dozens of smaller Northern California communities has greatly changed the rhythm of this region: How it works, where it shops and, in some cases, how it looks. It also scared away the tourists.        ``The point is that there is a rhythm. The heart of San Francisco has not stopped beating,'' said Dale Hess, spokesman for the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``We've talked to people who thought we fell off the side of the Earth.''        City tourism officials began touring the nation last week to reassure convention planners that San Francisco is still standing. Some restaurant owners were providing their customers with postcards of San Francisco street scenes, urging them to write to the folks back home. Advertisements will appear in national newspapers and magazines this week to invite people to come and take a look for themselves.        For San Francisco, the stakes are high: Tourism, a $3.3 billion-a-year industry, is the city's largest source of revenue.        At A. Sabella's, a Fisherman's Wharf institution, waiters were serving 100 meals a day last week instead of the customary 600.         Antone Sabella, a partner in the family-owned operation, laid off 15 full-time employees last week because business was so slow. It was the first time Sabella's has laid off workers since the restaurant got its start in 1920.        ``That's the part that really hurts,'' Sabella said. ``We're down to a minimum crew and we'll build it up as business comes back. It'll be months before we call back the part-timers. I think it'll stay like this for a while. Take a look: It's a ghost town out there.''        It was with a sense of resolve and pioneering spirit that the Bay Area struggled back to work last week for the first full week since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake unleashed its fury, killing at least 63 people, leaving thousands homeless, injuring more than 3,000 and destroying or damaging more than 100,000 homes.        Hundreds of thousands of commuters went to work in ferries, subways, buses, streetcars and trains - anything but a car. The Bay Bridge, damaged during the quake, won't reopen for weeks, and it could take two to three years before other critical roadways are rebuilt.        In some cases, people are switching jobs so that they don't have to make the commute. Safeway Stores and Pacific Bell, for example, are permitting some employees to switch so that they can work closer to home.        Since the earthquake, Steve Maita, manager of media relations for Pacific Bell, had ``tele-commuted'' two to three days a week. He said he'll continue to work by computer from his home in Oakland, and only go to his office in San Francisco when he needs to pick up documents or for meetings. ``So far, it seems to be working,'' he said.        After the earthquake, a San Francisco Chronicle poll found that 12 percent of Bay Area residents were planning to leave the area, or at least were thinking about it. It appears, too, that some people have abandoned plans to move to the Bay Area.        ``Northern California is going to become a tough sell,'' said Frank Patitucci, president of Relocation Consultants, Inc., in Mountain View. ``It was hard enough to get people here before because of high housing prices. This might be something that just makes it easier to say no.'' He said nearly two dozen of his firm's clients had postponed or canceled house-hunting trips to the Bay Area since the earthquake.        For many, the earthquake isn't over yet.        At the Pacific Garden Mall in the resort community of Santa Cruz, a chain-link fence surrounds the once-lovely Victorian storefronts as demolition crews prepare to finish what the earthquake started.        Farmers in Santa Cruz County have assessed damage estimates to their crops at $6 million, though they say the toll could climb higher. At Stanford University in Palo Alto, officials said it will take years to repair building damage, estimated at $160 million.        Dozens of businesses near the collapsed Cypress section of the Nimitz Freeway (Interstate 880) in Oakland will have to close down or move, and retailers in San Francisco's Union Square, North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf say business is off by 50 percent or more. Some hotels are reporting cancellations up through Thanksgiving.        Tourists, for the most part, have left town and local folks seem to be staying close to home.        The news wasn't all bad: Over the weekend, 6,000 members of the Association of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons opened a convention at Moscone Center as 5,000 members of the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy complete theirs. After much debate, the therapists decided to hold their meeting here as planned, including in their program a special two-day seminar on how to deal with earthquake-related stress.        ``It's 4:30 in the afternoon, and look at the cable cars. They're empty,'' lamented Ted Levin, a florist on normally bustling Union Square. ``It's the hype by the national media that's really killed us. You would have thought the city was leveled. It's hurt us a lot.'
