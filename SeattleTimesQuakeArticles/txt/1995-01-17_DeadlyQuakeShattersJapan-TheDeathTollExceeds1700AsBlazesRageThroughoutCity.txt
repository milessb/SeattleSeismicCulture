KOBE, Japan - Japan's worst earthquake in nearly half a century killed at least 1,700 people and injured 6,300 today as it toppled buildings, twisted major road and rail links and set parts of this port city ablaz     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama ordered troops into Kobe to help residents who were still battling blazes in the downtown area, some just with buckets, more than 12 hours after the quake struck at dawn.     As night closed in, rescuers dug into rubble with their hands to search for more than 900 missing people, including 20 patients trapped in the debris of a Kobe hospital.    "I thought it was the end of the world," said 64-year-old Minoru Takasu, whose house fell down around him in Nishinomiya, outside Kobe.     Dozens of cars were squashed by the collapse of an elevated highway just outside Kobe, and 10 trains were derailed.     Nearly 10,000 houses, buildings and other structures were destroyed or partially damaged by the quake, which struck Japan's second-most-populated area and one of its most industrialized, the National Police Agency said.     Damage and casualties were in a 60-mile radius around Kobe, extending to Japan's second-largest city of Osaka and to the ancient capital, Kyoto, where temples and priceless statues were damaged.     Nearly all the dead and more than half the injured were in the elegant city of Kobe, which nestles between mountains and the Sea of Japan.     The quake struck at 5:46 a.m. (12:46 p.m. PST yesterday) across the center of Honshu Island from the Japan Sea to the Pacific Ocean.     The epicenter of the quake, which measured 7.2 on the open-ended Richter scale, was located about 13 miles beneath the island of Awajishima, which is about 20 miles offshore from Kobe.     The tremor was the biggest quake in the Kansai area of central Japan since a 1946 tremor measuring 8.0 on the Richter scale. It was the biggest recorded in Kobe since statistics were first compiled in 1926.     Cars were left hanging from elevated highways, railway lines dangled in midair, and dazed residents clad only in pajamas sought shelter from winter cold.     There were yawning gaps in the elevated Hanshin Expressway that connects Osaka to Kobe.     Police said 14 drivers and passengers were killed as their cars were flung from the expressway or drove into three 100-yard-wide chasms left  by the collapse of road sections.     In California, where a magnitude 6.7 quake killed 61 people in the area around Northridge  a year ago to the day, President Clinton offered his condolences and any emergency assistance that Japan might need.     Clinton ordered a high-level team to Japan to help in the emergency response. He said the U.S. team would include representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Department.     There were no immediate reports of casualties among the thousands of Americans, Britons and other foreigners who live in Kobe.     Since the first tremor, more than 500 aftershocks have rattled nerves, hampered rescue efforts and brought down already-damaged buildings.     Water supplies were cut and residents went on panic buying sprees for food, emptying shop shelves.     "My shop was packed like a crowded commuter train," an employee at a convenience store told reporters.     The smell of gas from broken pipes hung over the area.     Telephone and other communications to Kobe were cut, and devastated roads were clogged with people trying to leave the city or get to areas to see if relatives were safe.     Experts had been warning that a major quake might be on its way. It came nine days after three major tremors, ranging from a 5.2 on the Richter scale just outside Tokyo to 6.9 and 4.2 readings in Hachinohe, 325 miles north of the capital.
