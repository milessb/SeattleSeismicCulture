LOS ANGELES - Earthquake damage to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is so extensive that the historic stadium might not be repaired in time for next fall's football season, officials said yesterday.     One Coliseum aide said that, pending a structural engineer's report, there is a possibility the structure might have to be demolished and rebuilt.    In any event, the officials believe that the costs of reopening the stadium could vastly exceed last week's estimate of $35 million.    Coliseum officials have not eliminated the possibility of repairing and reopening the facility - which was red-tagged as unsafe and off limits Sunday by city building inspectors - in time for football season. But they concede that time is very short to do so, and that work is contingent on a very quick decision by federal authorities to assume most of cost.    A spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, said consideration of Coliseum aid could take time. Schools have a higher priority.    During a tour of the stadium yesterday, Don Webb, the Coliseum Commission's project director for recent renovations of the facility, said a report from structural engineers is expected in two weeks.    "A (crack) runs through the concourse, through the tunnels and into the base of the foundation," he said. "What we don't see is extremely important. The question is whether this (facility) can be fixed, or whether it will have to be demolished.
