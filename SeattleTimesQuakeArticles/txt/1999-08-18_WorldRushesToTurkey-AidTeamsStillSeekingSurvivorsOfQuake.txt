ISTANBUL, Turkey - The death toll from Turkey's earthquake rose to nearly 3,800 today. Almost 18,000 people were reported injured as rescuers searched for survivors under the rubble and a huge refinery fire threatened to ignite a fertilizer plant.     Tens of thousands of people refused to return home as more than 250 aftershocks, several dozen of which were serious, rattled their confidence that the worst was over. Highway medians, parks, empty lots - anyplace open to the sky - were turned into makeshift tent cities across western Turkey.    Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said more than 1,055 rescue workers from 19 countries had arrived in the region by late afternoon. The government, meanwhile, opened talks with the World Bank on a package of quake aid.    Search-and-rescue teams and tons of equipment were dispatched by the U.S. and European nations, including a Swiss squad that helped after three other earthquakes in Turkey since 1983. Most of the units include dogs trained to sniff out people trapped in the rubble.     Even Greece, a regional rival, sent a military plane with emergency supplies.    U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan pledged "relief and rehabilitation" funds. In Geneva, the International Red Cross launched an appeal for about $7 million to aid about 100,000 quake victims.     State Deparment spokesman James Rubin said today, "Happily, we have had no reports of Americans injured or dead in the quake. The U.S. consul in Istanbul is in Izmit to check on Americans there."      The fire at Turkey's largest oil refinery, in the city of Izmit, burned out of control for a second day, forcing authorities to evacuate a three-mile area today where an untold number of people remained trapped under collapsed buildings.    "We need more rescue teams; we need at least 250 teams, because that is the number of buildings that have been destroyed," Mayor Sefa Sirmen said.    Firefighting aircraft dropped special chemical foam to try to control the blaze that threatened to engulf the entire field of 30 storage tanks containing 700,000 tons of crude oil. The refinery produces 35 percent of Turkey's fuel, but stockpiles are expected to make up for losses. Turkey does not export petroleum.    The general manager of the plant, Husamettin Danis, said five or six tanks were on fire, and firefighters could not use pumps to bring sea water to the site because the quake had knocked out electricity.    Authorities feared the inferno could spill over to a nearby fertilizer plant with 8,000 tons of dangerous ammonia.    Yesterday's immense quake shook western Turkey from Istanbul to the Golcuk area about 80 miles to the southeast.    The magnitude of the quake initially was reported as 7.8 However, the head of Istanbul's Kandilli Observatory, Ahmet Mete Isikara, today revised the magnitude to 7.4.    Throughout western Turkey, bodies overflowed hospital morgues and were stacked in refrigerated meat trucks. The government has recorded 3,479 deaths. Late today, the Anatolia news agency reported the number had risen to 3,789.     The total was almost certain to grow as more bodies are recovered.    "Murderers!" read the headline in the daily Hurriyet newspaper, which accused contractors of using poor materials to build shoddy structures. The paper said it had warned of "unscrupulous killers" after a June 1998 earthquake in the southern city of Adana.    "Again unsound buildings. Again thieving and unscrupulous contractors," the paper said. "Those who did not listen to the warnings are responsible for the disaster."     Some Golcuk residents complained that rescue efforts appeared focused on collapsed buildings at a naval base, where more than 150 military personnel, including some top commanders, were missing.    "Who is helping us?" cried a woman, standing before a toppled home where she said neighbors and family members were buried.    As many as 10,000 people could still be trapped in the rubble around Golcuk, a town near the quake's epicenter, Mayor Ismail Baris said. Thousands more were missing in Istanbul and elsewhere.    Private NTV television showed waves washing into Golcuk, flooding part of the seaside town. It said water had advanced nearly 1,000 feet inland. Scientists at Kandilli had no immediate explanation for the flooding, although they said it might be due to the shock of the quake.    The earthquake was felt as far east as Ankara, 200 miles away, and across parts of the Balkans.    The memory - and fear - of quakes runs deep in Turkey, which sits on an earthquake-prone belt known as the Anatolia fault. The worst earthquake in Turkish history killed an estimated 33,000 people in the eastern province of Erzincan in 1939.Caption:  PHOTO: MAP1) THE AP: RESCUERS PULL UMRAN SAVUS, 30, FROM UNDER THE RUINS  OF A QUAKE-TOPPLED BUILDING IN ISTANBUL.
