The aging Northeast 45th Street Viaduct, which links the University District to University Village and Northeast Seattle, closed Monday for nearly three months for two major fixes: a seismic retrofitting and a replacement of the west approach. The structure is an important thoroughfare that carries 20,000 vehicles a day, many heading to the University of Washington, and also is a vital link to Seattle Children's hospital. The viaduct is to remain closed to all vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians until Sept. 10, the day before the first Huskies home football game. The only bus that uses the viaduct, the 25, will be temporarily rerouted through the UW campus. The Seattle Department of Transportation awarded the contract to Guy F. Atkinson Construction. During the closure, traffic is being detoured to nearby major east-west arterials, including Northeast 65th Street to the north and Montlake Boulevard Northeast and Northeast Pacific Street to the south. The city is doing the work during the summer because that is a slower time at the UW. Construction crews will work 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. seven days a week. Some work may be done after 11 p.m. periodically in order to complete the project on time. The city said neighbors can expect an increase in noise from construction. Susie Plummer, general manager of University Village, has said shopping-center officials are not worried the closure will cost it customers. University Village did ask the city to improve walkways from the campus to the shopping center for students who work at stores there, and the city agreed. The city has replaced light bulbs and cut overgrown brush away from the route. Susan Gilmore: 206-464-2054 or sgilmore@seattletimes.comCaption:  mapThe Seattle Times: Street closure (G4R1O407T)
