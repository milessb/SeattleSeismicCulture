MOSCOW - Rescuers probed with bulldozers and shovels today for survivors in the soggy mass of dirt and rock an earthquake sent crashing into three Central Asian mountain villages.        The official Tass news agency estimated 1,000 people were killed in slides loosened by the tremor as it struck a rich agricultural region of the Soviet republic of Tadzhikistan before dawn yesterday.        ``There is little hope (of finding survivors) because of the flood of dirt and mud,'' Erkin Kasimov, a spokesman for the republic's foreign ministry, said today. ``But while there is any hope, the rescuers will keep working.''        Rescuers put up tents and built huts for survivors and worked to restore communications and electricity, he said.        Official reports said more than 100 people were hospitalized in the Tadzhik capital of Dushanbe, 20 miles from where the Soviet Union's second devastating earthquake in two months had caused the most destruction.        Vitaly Zhukov, deputy head of the republic's official news agency, said 11 people died during the night in Dushanbe hospitals.        The Communist Party newspaper Pravda blamed the conditions for mudslides on heavy snows followed by a thaw in hills overlooking the stricken villages of Sharora, Okuli-Bolo and Okuli-Poyen.        The thaw moistened the earthen walls of canals that stretched down to the villages, and when the quake hit, the rich earth loosened and Pravda said it ``moved in a huge mass onto the villages'' - about 1 1/2 to 1 1/4 miles.        ``There is a danger of new mudslides in similar places in the event of a new natural blow,'' the paper said.        Pravda said previous experience had shown that the Soviet Union is careless in construction of buildings, especially in rural areas. However, it did not specifically blame poor construction for any of the deaths in the area about 1,800 miles southeast of Moscow.        The U.S. Geological Survey said yesterday's quake measured 5.4 on the Richter scale.        Zhukov said many of the surviving women and children had been evacuated, but some remained behind in hopes of finding relatives.        Zainiddin Nasreddinov, editor in chief of the Tadzhik news agency, estimated that about 600 people were killed in Sharora - almost the entire population.        The earthquake unhinged a wall of loess at least five miles wide that buried Okuli-Bolo and much of Sharora, said Kasimov. Officials said most of the victims were asleep at the time.        Residents of Okuli-Poyen escaped before the slide could reach their homes, Kasimov said in Dushanbe.        In Okuli-Bolo and Okuli-Poyen, ``everything is destroyed - all the homes, the schools, the hospitals and clinics, the stores,'' Nasreddinov said.        Okuli-Bolo is a ``heap of rubble'' and the chairman of a local economic cooperative, Hairrulo Yuldashev, said the households of 70 peasant families were ``completely demolished and buried by the landslide,'' Tass said.
