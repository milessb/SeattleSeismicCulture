SEATTLE - Metropolitan King County Councilman Pete von Reichbauer, still shaky over the Seattle area's 5.0 earthquake Jan. 28, is calling on King County Executive Gary Locke to develop an earthquake preparedness strategy.        Von Reichbauer was to have introduced a motion today that would ask Locke's office to put together a plan that creates a communications link between the county's emergency-management office and seismic experts at the University of Washington; develops communications networks for county road, public safety and other work crews, and coordinates emergency broadcasts of earthquake information with local media.     A spokeswoman from Locke's office said work on such a strategy had been going on for several weeks
