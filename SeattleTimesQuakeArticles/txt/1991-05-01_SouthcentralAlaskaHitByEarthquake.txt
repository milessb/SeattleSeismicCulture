A strong earthquake hit Southcentral Alaska on last night, triggering rock slides onto a major highway, cracking building windows and overturning cupboards.     There were no reports of serious damage or injuries.     The quake registered a magnitude of 6 on the Richter scale, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer said today. Preliminary reports had put the magnitude at 6.6.     The temblor was centered on the southern border of Denali National Park just south of Mount McKinley, about 110 miles northwest of Anchorage and about 50 miles northwest of the town Talkeetna.     The 1964 Alaska quake that killed 131 people measured 8.4 on the Richter scale.
