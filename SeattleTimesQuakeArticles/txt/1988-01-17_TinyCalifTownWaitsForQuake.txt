PARKFIELD, Calif. _ A few miles north of this tiny town, scientist Tom McEvilly and his colleagues have placed 114 seismometers in a mile-deep hole, waiting for movement that may signal a long-predicted severe earthquake        At the one-room school in Parkfield, population 34, teacher Duane Hamann abruptly orders his students to drop to their knees and cover their heads three or four times a week, a drill meant to prepare the children for the temblor.        And 17 miles to the south in Cholame, Aggie's Cafe owner Agnes Bayus declares: ``I truly believe we are going to have a big earthquake. God help us, because people will not be prepared for it.''        Life just hasn't been the same in the oak-dotted pastures of the Cholame Valley since 1985, when the U.S. Geological Survey issued the nation's first official long-term earthquake prediction.        The forecast for a severe quake measuring about 6 on the Richter scale has spurred what the agency calls the nation's premier experiment aimed at predicting temblors.        The USGS said it was 95 percent sure the quake would rupture a 20-mile stretch of the San Andreas Fault, which runs smack through Parkfield, sometime during a 10-year period centered around this month.        The prediction was based on the fact that the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas has ruptured in quakes measuring 5.5 to 6.3 on the Richter scale roughly every 22 years since 1857, most recently in 1966.        ``We're in the final years of the process that is going to result in a magnitude-6 earthquake right here,'' McEvilly, a seismologist at the University of California, Berkeley, said recently as reporters toured the scenic California valley situated halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco.        The seismometers McEvilly installed in the mile-deep abandoned oil well are among scores of monitoring devices placed in the valley to learn what kind of changes in the ground occur before the major quake.        They also hope to issue a warning 72 hours before the Parkfield quake.        The predicted quake should not cause any significant damage beyond the immediate area of Parkfield, said Richard Andrews, the assistant director for Southern California for the Office of Emergency Services.        But there is a 2 percent to 10 percent chance the Parkfield quake could grow into or trigger a quake as large as magnitude 7 that could severely damage or destroy unreinforced masonry buildings in nearby towns, said William Bakun, chief scientist of the earthquake-prediction experiment.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.        Since October 1985, seismic activity near Parkfield has prompted dozens of low-level alerts, Bakun said.          Only A-level alerts _ the highest of four categories of alert _ will spur a public warning.        Parkfield residents, even the young, have learned to wait for that warning.        ``I'm sort of scared,'' 10-year-old Jeremy Howard said. But he added that he's ``not all that scared because I've been through a few.'
