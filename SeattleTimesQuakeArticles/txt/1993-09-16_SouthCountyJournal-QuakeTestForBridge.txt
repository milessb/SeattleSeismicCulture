Quake test for bridge: The Tacoma Narrows Bridge will be shaking this weekend.    Researchers plan to run 50,000-pound trucks filled with gravel across the bridge to simulate earthquake trauma. The mile-long span will be closed from midnight to 5 a.m. Saturday and Sunday for the test, the culmination of a week of study.    Since Monday, a team from Johns Hopkins University has been trying to determine how the bridge would stand up to an earthquake.
