BAKER CITY, Ore. - A former Cold War seismic station near here is being converted into a site to monitor clandestine nuclear-weapons tests around the globe.    The U.S. Air Force seismic observatory was in operation from 1962-1965, tracking nuclear testing in the Soviet Union.    A $319,274 grant from the Air Force is financing conversion of the site to detect secret nuclear weapons tests.    When completed, the seismographs at the site will be able to detect ground vibrations smaller than a millionth of an inch - the equivalent of the movement of air caused by someone blowing out a candle 50 feet away.
