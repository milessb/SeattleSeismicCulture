SEATTLE - A moderate earthquake shook Western Washington early this morning, measuring 4.0 in magnitude and centered approximately 20 miles west of Bremerton.     The quake occurred at 1:22 a.m., said Steve Malone, research professor at the University of Washington geophysics program. There were no immediate reports of damage or injury.     Malone said the quake was "widely felt," prompting reports from nearby Olympia and Shelton."It was pretty deep, about 25 miles deep, which is deep enough that it's not likely to cause any damage even in the epicentral area," Malone said.    At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, workers checked runways for cracks and buckling after the quake and found nothing. The runways are routinely checked following quakes, an airport official said.
