ANCHORAGE, Alaska     A moderate-sized earthquake rattled residents and briefly knocked out power to part of the city, but caused no injuries or serious damage.     The quake, measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale, struck shortly after 10 p.m. yesterday, said Bob Hammond of the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center.     It was centered 10 miles northwest of Anchorage and was widely felt in south-central Alaska, Hammond said. It was followed by an aftershock of undetermined magnitude.     The 1964 Alaska quake that killed 131 people measured 8.4 on the Richter scale.
