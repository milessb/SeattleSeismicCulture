SAN FRANCISCO - The death of Buck Helm, dubbed ``Lucky Bucky'' after he survived for four days in the wreckage of a freeway destroyed by the Oct. 17 earthquake, came suddenly Saturday night, just one day after physicians had announced that their celebrity patient was recovering at an encouraging rate and was expected to breathe on his own, without the use of a respirator, within the next few days    Helm, a colorful longshoreman, died of respiratory failure at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland 28 days after his celebrated rescue. He was 58.        ``He took a very sudden turn for the worse,'' said Ron Treleven, a hospital spokesman. ``Doctors had been so heartened by his great progress.'' He said that attempts to revive Helm by cardiopulmonary resuscitation were unsuccessful.        The rescue from the collapsed section of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland on Oct. 21 was the stuff of movies. Indeed, Helm had received more than 50 movie offers, and they were coming so fast and furious that the Helm family had hired a Beverly Hills press agent to sift through them.        ``We're just stunned,'' the family's attorney, Vasilious Choulos, said yesterday. ``The family is in a state of shock. They had every reason to believe that he was on the mend. We all felt he was going to make it.''        Helm is survived by his ex-wife and ``best friend,'' Lorene Helm, and four children - Desiree, 12; Jeff, 16; Marc, 22; and Greg, 35.        ``The family of Buck Helm would like to thank all those who have shown care and concern during the past 28 days,'' said Gary Frischer, a family spokesman. ``To many, Buck had become a symbol of survival and hope. For the Helms, the thousands of cards and letters from all corners of the world gave Buck and the family strength and encouragement and for that they are forever grateful.''        Helm, a shipping clerk at the Port of Oakland, had been trapped in his subcompact car between the upper and lower decks of the freeway in a section that had collapsed to a single level.        He was the 42nd person to die from injuries on the elevated roadway, which collapsed during a 7.1-magnitude earthquake Oct. 17.        Rescue workers had given up hope that there were any more survivors in the rubble when an engineer detected movement early Oct. 21. In a four-hour rescue operation, a paramedic and two firefighters squeezed into the dark cavern where Helm lay trapped after construction workers blasted a tunnel that they were able to slide through.        A diabetic, Helm suffered broken ribs and a neck fracture and his kidney had failed, though that function had returned to near normal in recent days. He had been listed in serious but stable condition since Oct. 23.        Admirers said yesterday that the inspiration of Helm's fight for life would continue.        ``Buck Helm may be dead, but his heart still beats in mine and in the courage he gave all of us at a time when we sorely needed to share that courage,'' said Jimmy Price, the San Francisco band leader who wrote ``The Ballad of Buck Helm.''        ``Now he's gone,'' Price added. ``But that lift he gave us will always be with us.''        ``It's a tragedy that it ended this way . . . (but) he symbolizes a real strength that we all can draw upon - an inspiration to draw on our strength - if we only choose to,'' said Lory Hartland, a waitress at the Nugget Restaurant in Weaverville that Helm visited every weekend for french fries or a slice of pie and a cup of coffee. ``He did survive those four days. And he really did fight.''    --  Compiled from Baltimore Sun, Knight-Ridder Newspapers and United Press International.Caption:  PHOTOBUCK HELM
