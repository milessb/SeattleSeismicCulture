Eleven years old and he's already made it to the Majors. For Masashi Ono - a Little League pitcher from Kobe, Japan - last night was the stuff of which dreams are made.     Ono threw out a confident first pitch as the Mariners got ready to face off with the Milwaukee Brewers at the Kingdome.     "I'm happy to be here, and I'm not nervous," Ono said through a translator before the pitch.     Ono is one of 15 Kobe Little League Dream Team players who toured the Kingdome and met Mariner players before departing to Eureka, Mont., to participate in a one-week cultural exchange with teams from Canada, Santa Cruz, Calif., and Eureka.     The tour was the brainchild of Japanese businesswoman Hitomi Tanaka, who wanted to give something to the people of Kobe after a devastating earthquake struck the city Jan. 17. Tanaka's daughter was visiting friends in Kobe when the earthquake hit.     "From the moment I had discovered that my daughter had escaped unharmed, I committed to doing something to help the people who have suffered and especially the children," Tanaka said. Twenty-six American and Japanese companies pitched in for expenses.     The 11- and 12-year-olds were chosen by a lottery of six teams and all are living in temporary housing with their families since their homes were destroyed.      While their immediate families survived the quake, they all know someone who died in the tremor, said Mike Hara of the Seattle Lions Club.     "It was like a nightmare," said Shuhei Kashiwagi, 11, about the quake.      But thoughts of home were far away as the young guests huddled around Ken Griffey Jr. and Edgar Martinez and timidly thrust forward baseballs and autograph books.     Treated in VIP fashion, they toured the sky boxes, were allowed to view warm-up from the field and dined on gourmet stadium fare such as hotdogs and baked beans.     This trip also gives the boys the opportunity to play the sport they love, because many of Kobe's playing fields now are filled with temporary housing for quake victims.     "It's my first time in the States so I'm really happy," Kashiwagi said. "I just hope to have good games.Caption:  PHOTO1) LINDA COAN / SEATTLE TIMES: FIFTEEN LITTLE LEAGUE DREAM TEAM PLAYERS FROM KOBE, JAPAN, INCLUDING SHINICHI KIMURA, CENTER, AND MASASHI ONO, RIGHT, TAKE IN THE SIGHTS BEFORE THE MARINERS GAME IN THE KINGDOME LAST NIGHT.2) AN INJURED KEN GRIFFEY JR.
