TACOMA (UPI) _ In light of the devastation following last month's massive earthquake in Mexico, a Tacoma architect warns that similar damage could occur around the Tacoma tideflats following a quake of the same magnitude        Del Hobbs, who visited Mexico City as part of a four-member team of seismic structure specialists studying the devastation, said the areas hardest hit were on soft soils and fill material similar to the tideflats.        Mid- and high-rise office and apartment buildings standing on the soft, shift-prone soil of a former lake bed crumbled in the earthquakes that struck the city, he said.        Earthquake experts say soft soil becomes highly unstable during a major tremor and everthing built on the that soil sinks.        The Tacoma tideflat soil is so prone to shifting that a seismic gauge set up at a tideflats fire station often is triggered by the rumble of nearby semi-trucks or trains, said Charles Pearson, supervisor in the Tacoma building department.        ``I don't want to be scaring people,'' Hobbs said. ``Our building codes and design engineers are practicing state-of-the-art construction techniques, but there's a tremendous amount of knowledge that still needs to be gained.''        Hobbs said his team, which was assembled by the California Council of The American Institute of Architects, visited Mexico City to learn how Puget Sound and other West Coast areas might better survive a major quake.        Team members found that ``the short, rigid masonry buildings, and the taller, flexible steel buildings performed well,'' Hobbs said. ``Some had no broken glass in the windows at all.''        The buildings that suffered the worst damage were the brittle, middle-rise structures of reinforced concrete in which upper floors crumbled through lower floors, Hobbs said.        He said the team also learned that preparedness for dealing with an earthquake's destruction is as important as building sound buildings.        ``We found virtually every architect and engineer in the area pressed into immediate service to evaluate structures and to get facilities back into reasonable order,'' he said.        The earthquakes were further motivation for West Coast seismic experts to develop a regional disaster assistance plan.        Once an earthquake hits California, Oregon or Washington, ``qualified resource people need to be identified and a program established to assist a community to get back on its feet,'' Hobbs said. ``In Mexico City there were not enough resource people to go around.'
