PEORIA, Ariz. - A cynic or a union rep might suggest Makoto Suzuki left one disaster area for another when he stopped in at the Seattle training camp.        Here recently to have his shoulder checked out by Mariner team doctors, the reliever was back in the U.S. just a day after leaving Kobe, Japan, where he had spent the five weeks since the earthquake helping his family recover.       "The family is fine, I'm fine," the pitcher said. "That's most important."         Don Nomura, Suzuki's agent, was in Japan with his client much of the time.       "It really is a mess over there," Nomura said of the upheaval that destroyed much of Suzuki's home town. "It usually takes three hours to get to Kobe from Tokyo. Right now, it's taking 10 hours."         Suzuki's family is well and the family home was not as badly damaged as the youngster had heard before he went back. "It was not leaning to the side," Suzuki said, with words and his hands. "Just a few cracks."         The right-hander said his sister and brother told him the quake was terrifying, waking them up in predawn darkness about 5 a.m. When he reached them days later, everything in the house was still tossed about in disarray.      "Nothing in right place, nothing," Suzuki said. "Everything on floor."         Nomura said water service had only recently been turned on.     "The gas is still off," he said. "People are still cooking outside."         The agent said Suzuki's family and neighbors had been fortunate to live in the Suma area in the western part of the city. The earthquake's epicenter was in the harbor to the southwest.     "Just a half a mile from Mak's house, there wasn't a thing standing," Nomura said. "It was an area of older houses, close together. One went on fire and they all burned down. In Japan, you hardly ever see open space and there, that's all there is now."         Suzuki will stay in the U.S. for a while, in case the strike is settled. The Seattle medical staff said that physically he is ready for camp, if the union calls an end to the strike.        Unable to enter any of the practice fields, Suzuki threw for 10 minutes in the parking lot with trainer Rick Griffin recently. "He looked fine," said Dr. Larry Pedegana, who performed exploratory surgery on Suzuki last fall and said he saw no serious problems. "Very fluid."         Griffin said Suzuki actually is at the end of the maintenance period on his shoulder. "His strength is really good," Griffin said. "All he's got to do now is pitch." Mariners rout Rockies     TUCSON, Ariz. - Manny Cora had two hits and drove in three runs yesterday, leading the Mariners past the Colorado Rockies 8-3 in a spring-training game.    Colorado's Jeff Sellers, who pitched for Boston in the late 1980s, gave up five runs and six hits in 1 1/3 innings.    Brad Moore, a projected starting pitcher for the Rockies, fractured a finger on his right hand when he slipped after showering in his hotel room.     Moore is expected to be out at least two weeksCaption:  PHOTOMAKOTO SUZUKI
