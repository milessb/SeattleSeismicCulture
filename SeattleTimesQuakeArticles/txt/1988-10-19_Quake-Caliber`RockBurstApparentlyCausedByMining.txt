MULLAN, Idaho - An apparent mining-caused ``rock burst'' measuring between 4.0 and 4.2 on the Richter scale shook the Lucky Friday Mine yesterday, officials said.        Bill Booth, a spokesman for the Coeur d'Alene-based Hecla Mining Co., which owns the silver and lead mine, said no one was injured. The 2:15 p.m. seismic eruption 5,100 feet below the surface apparently occurred shortly after the mine was blasted with dynamite.        Rock bursts, which are essentially earthquakes, generally occur at deep underground mines when the stresses are high in the rock.        Some 50 workers on the afternoon shift yesterday were ordered not to report to work. The mine reopened today.        The blast was set shortly after the end of the day shift when all 60 miners were safely out of the mine and off their shift, Booth said.        ``They spend their day drilling holes,'' Booth said. ``And at the end of the day they blast and that breaks loose 8-by-8-foot cubes of ore.''        Bob Hammond, director of the North Idaho Seismic Array, which monitors such activity from the University of Idaho's College of Mines, said the incident was either a mining-caused ``rock burst'' or an outright earthquake.        ``They are inducing earthquakes to happen and they are labeled as rock bursts,'' Hammond said. ``Rock bursts just occur near mining.''        ``In this case people have opened up a tunnel and it's been proven stresses concentrate around an opening,'' Hammond said.        ``It's definitely the largest rock burst that we've had,'' Hammond said. ``The largest previous one was on the order of a magnitude of 2.1 several years back.''        Booth said one person was killed in a ``rock burst'' in 1986 at the mine.        The North Idaho Seismic Array was set up three years ago to monitor seismic activity in the Coeur d'Alene mining district, known as the Silver Valley, Hammond said.        The Lucky Friday Mine produced 667,000 ounces of silver last year, as well as 4,500 tons of lead and smaller quantities of zinc, copper and gold. It was reopened in June 1987 after a 14-month shutdown caused by low metals prices.
