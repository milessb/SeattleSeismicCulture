SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A major earthquake struck an 800-mile stretch of central Chile, crumbling houses in villages, rocking skyscrapers in the capital and cutting communications lines. The government said today at least 124 people were killed and 2,000 were injured.        Santiago and the Pacific Coast cities of Valparaiso and Vina Del Mar _ with a combined population of about 6 million _ appeared to be the hardest hit by the quake, which struck yesterday evening.        People camped among the debris in city streets, away from their weakened homes, as dozens of aftershocks rumbled through the region all night and through this morning.        Authorities warned that walls in many of the adobe homes in towns near Santiago were cracked and that they might collapse in the aftershocks.        ``Our house may collapse anytime. I think I'll stay outside at least until daylight,'' said Monica Garrico, a housewife who was camping with neighbors on a sidewalk in a Santiago suburb. ``The walls are full of cracks,'' she said.        In Golden, Colo., the National Earthquake Center said the quake measured 7.4 on the Richter scale.        Melipilla, a town southwest of Santiago, was heavily damaged, the government said. Deaths also were reported in the cities of Rancagua and San Antonio, and the quake affected La Rioja, San Juan and Mendoza provinces.        When the quake struck Santiago, thousands of people ran screaming from their homes, and broken glass showered the streets.        Ten people died when the front section of a church collapsed during Mass in San Bernardo, just outside Santiago, said Jaime Garcia, governor of the capital.        The quake shook Santiago for about five minutes. Jose Carcamo, who lives on the sixth floor of a downtown Santiago appartment building, said: ``All of a sudden, this huge cloud of reddish dust came from nowhere. I thought it was the end of the world.''    .    Chilean officials said the quake's epicenter was 25 miles off the coastal resort city of Algarrobo, 88 miles northwest of Santiago.        A Santiago police spokesman said there were no major looting problems.Caption:  MAP
