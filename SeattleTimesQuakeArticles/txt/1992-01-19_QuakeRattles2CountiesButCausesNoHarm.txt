The quake occurred at 11:52 p.m.  Measurements put its magnitude at 3.2 on the Richter scale.    It was centered in northern Mason County near the border of Kitsap County, seismologists said.    The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake of 3.2 is unlikely to cause any significant damage.
