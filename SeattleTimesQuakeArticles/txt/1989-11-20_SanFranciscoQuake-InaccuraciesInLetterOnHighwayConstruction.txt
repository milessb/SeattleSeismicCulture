As a concerned taxpayer and general contractor, I read with interest Mr. Burt Talcott's letter published Oct. 27. The premise that failure of the I-880 freeway in the recent Bay Area quake was the result of shoddy construction and faulty inspection is not correct         The apparent lack of ``girding bands,'' column ties that confine the vertical column reinforcing, is due to the fact that  they were not required as a standard practice in column design when the I-880 structures were built in the early 1950s.         Further, the notion that the failures were the result of a system using the lowest bidder is also incorrect. The state highway departments, engineers, designers and contractors must follow strict rules related to the construction of all structures. These building codes describe how structures are to be designed and require continuous inspections to monitor how the work is put in place.         A major reason the failures occurred on I-880 and in the Marina District relates to the geology of those locations. Man-made fills were not the cause, but rather the deep geology of those sites.         Mr. Talcott does make a valid point regarding maintenance of our highways and bridges. Even the best roadway and bridge designs require maintenance.  As taxpayers, we must be willing to direct our elected officials to invest taxes to maintain our infrastructure.         I am convinced the Bay Area tragedy was not made worse by the acts of engineers and contractors, but rather it was through the skill of those same professionals that more property and lives were not destroyed.
