Roslyn and Alan Woodle have a fat notebook bulging with improvement ideas for their pale-green, 1914-era home in Seattle's Phinney Ridge neighborhood. This summer, to Roslyn's great relief, they accomplished a major upgrade.      Doing the work themselves, at a cost of $975, they bolted the two-story wood-frame house to its foundation. In other words, they earthquake-proofed it, and although it's no guarantee they won't suffer damage if a big shaker hits, Roslyn, in particular, feels a lot more confident.      The mother of three school-age kids, she says "your thinking changes when you have children, and this is just one of those things you have to do. It helps you sleep at night."       Does the threat of earthquake damage - or worse - also have you uneasy?       Do you want to know how at-risk your home is and what to do about it?       Reserve this Saturday, and you'll find out.      That's the day of Seattle's second annual Disaster Saturday. Co-sponsored by Seattle Project Impact (a federally funded disaster-mitigation initiative) and the Seattle Disaster Aid and Response Team, the event is basically one-stop shopping for anyone wanting information about earth movement and how to protect against it.     The event will be held at Seattle Central Community College, with parking directly behind the college. The event itself is free; parking is $3.        "We all know we live in an area that has natural hazards," says Ines Pearce, Seattle Project Impact coordinator. "This is making the information available about the resources to assist homeowners and small businesses.'        A series of workshops, exhibits and computer demonstrations will cover numerous topics, including: known earthquake faults and landslide areas, basic structural retrofitting of homes, how to secure a home's contents against quake damage, electricity and generator safety, and even Y2K neighborhood preparedness.     And among those on hand to answer questions will be seismologists, geologists, contractors who've been specially trained to retrofit homes, and building-permit officials from Seattle's Department of Design, Construction and Land Use (DCLU).        "Basically, for every workshop we have the most qualified person speaking or more than one," says Pearce, who adds, "this is open to everyone (no matter where they live), because it's such valuable information we don't want to limit anybody." That includes officials from other jurisdictions and small-business owners wanting to protect their businesses.     Last year's Disaster Saturday led to scheduling approximately 20 workshops specifically for homeowners within the city of Seattle. Unlike the big event, these two-hour workshops focus solely on the nitty gritty of earthquake retrofitting, providing owners with the knowledge to do it themselves - or the insight that they'd be better off hiring a pro.    Included is information on the city's streamlined permitting process (retrofitting a Seattle home requires a permit).      Another Disaster Saturday outgrowth has been a series of professional training workshops for contractors; those who complete the course go on a list that's available to the public.     (Both types of workshops are ongoing. Homeowners can get information about retrofit classes as well as the contractor list by calling 206-382-2159. Contractors can sign up for training at 206-543-2310.)       Roger Faris, director of the Phinney Neighborhood Association's Well Home Program, has taught some 20 retrofit workshops over the past year. He says he's been surprised at the variety of ages and backgrounds of the approximately 800 individuals who've taken the $10 course.      "It's really every sort of person . . . from people who've just bought their first home to people thinking about turning it over to someone else," he says.     And because the Phinney Neighborhood Association loans out the expensive tools needed to do the job, including a rotohammer that cuts effortlessly through concrete, Faris says the project is within the grasp of many do-it-yourselfers, particularly those whose homes have uncomplicated foundations. Saving a bundle of money       That was the case with the Woodles' house. Theirs is a straightforward 44-foot-by-25-foot rectangle. Initially, Roslyn confesses, they'd planned to hire a professional. But bids topping $5,000 convinced them to tackle the project themselves.      That meant first taking Faris' course, and then doing what he only half-jokingly says has been perhaps the biggest factor preventing those who've taken his class from actually accomplishing the seismic upgrade: dealing with basement clutter.      "Their basements are typically full of stuff, and they need (to get it out of the way) to do a really careful evaluation of the existing structure," Faris says. "So people start thinking about retrofitting by having yard sales; that's really the first step to retrofitting."        After the Woodles straightened their basement, they next removed the sheetrock to expose the foundation. Then, using instructions and information gleaned from Faris' class, they designed the retrofit, showing exactly how and where the foundation would be anchored.     "It took an hour or two to draw the plans; it was that simple," Roslyn recalls.     Once the DCLU reviewed their plans and issued a permit, the Woodles set to work. With the aid of a roto-hammer, they affixed anchor bolts and anchor plates to the foundation and then fastened them to the wooden mud sill atop the concrete. Next came metal framing clips to anchor the underside of the home's first floor to the short, wooden pony walls atop the concrete foundation.      Then a city inspector reviewed their work and gave them the go ahead to complete it. This meant using special fasteners to affix "sheer walls" - the plywood sheathing that covers the pony walls and gives the house's underpinnings the strength to withstand a quake's side-to-side motion.     In all, it took the couple eight weekends to do the job. Faris figures a homeowner could do it in a week, working solid.     Roslyn Woodle says she's always had earthquake insurance, and doing the seismic upgrade didn't affect her rate. But to her that didn't really matter.     Instead, it was actually having the retrofit completed that was most important.      "It was just one of those things we felt we should do to protect our home . . . it was a safety thing," she says. ------------------------------- Coming Saturday      Disaster Saturday, a free community forum on earthquake preparedness      8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.     Seattle Central Community College      1631 Broadway, Seattle      Information: 206-615-0288 or 206-233-7123Caption:  PHOTO: ILLUSTRATION1) THOMAS JAMES HURST / THE SEATTLE TIMES: ROGER FARIS OF THE  PHINNEY NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION DISPLAYS SOME FO THE TOOLS THAT  HOMEOWNERS CAN BORROW TO DO THEIR OWN RETROFITTING, INCLUDING A  ROTOHAMMER AT TOP RIGHT.2) THOMAS JAMES HURST / THE SEATTLE TIMES: AN ANCHOR PLATE CAN BE USED  TO STABILIZE A FOUNDATION IN AREAS WHERE ANCHOR BOLTS WON'T WORK.3) SOURCE: CALIFORNIA SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION: HOW TO MAKE YOUR HOUSE  QUAKE-SAFE (ILLUSTRATION NOT AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY)
