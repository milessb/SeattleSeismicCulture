We are sitting near our television sets hearing about all the damage that the earthquake has done to California. We know we are due for a quake that could cause similar damage to our area, and we are being advised on how we can prepare for the safety and well-being of our families         I haven't yet heard anything about the safety of day-care children. Painful as it is, we need to say out loud to parents and day-care providers: ``Make a plan for yourselves.''         Parents, know what kind of plan your day-care providers have for your children in case of a quake. What will they do to protect your children from the immediate danger? How will they care for injured children? How will they care for your children when you aren't able to get there right away - when you aren't able to get there for 10, 15, 20 hours or more.         What will they do with your children if you are killed (ugh) or seriously injured? If you are a single parent, you need to take these questions even more seriously. If you are new to this area and do not have family or close friends nearby, how will your children be cared for?         The more prepared we are, the better chance of survival and the less we'll need to depend on public-support systems.         Don't leave your children stranded just because you are afraid to think about it or because you'll plan it ``later.'' Being prepared takes some of the fear out of major problems.              - Kathy Murphy, Brie
