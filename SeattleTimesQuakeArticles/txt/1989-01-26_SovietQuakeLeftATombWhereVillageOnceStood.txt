SHARORA, U.S.S.R. - When the wall of mud and stone crashed down on this Central Asian hillside settlement, obliterating it in seconds, ``it was like a bomb had exploded over our heads,'' said one villager, Kibo Rakhikov        The slide, unleashed early Monday by an earthquake in Soviet Tadzhikistan, buried one-story, mud-brick and prefabricated concrete homes in three remote mountain villages and killed 274 people, officials said.        In Sharora, it left a soft, moonlike landscape of rolling, moist earth and no signs of life except for white roofs that peeked through the grime or scraps of brightly colored cloth carried by a morning breeze from the hills.        Yesterday, bulldozers, cranes and dumptrucks worked to clear Sharora's main streets of crumbled brick, broken pieces of roofing, trees and mud.        Since custom in this mostly Moslem republic north of Afghanistan and China is not to try to recover the bodies of people buried alive, the village will be fenced off and turned into a common grave. Two hundred seven villagers died here.        Two families, however, have insisted on searching for the bodies of loved ones, regional Communist Party chief Khusayin Kasymov said, and a dozen policemen and villagers, wielding shovels and hoes and assisted by an excavator, cut into the dense earth yesterday.        For this more than 300-year-old settlement, the end came in seconds. The mudslide covered much of Sharora with a 300-yard-wide, chocolate-colored earthen slather.        Rakhikov, 27, a policeman, was roused by the quake. He made it into the street in time to see an inky black mass tumble onto the village from the hills above.        ``It was like a bomb had exploded on top of our heads, or a thunderstorm had broke,'' he said.        In house No. 1 at Sharora's dairy farm, herdsman Saifulo Khodzharayev, 30, and seven members of his family were buried alive and suffocated in the earthquake, which measured 5.4 on the Richter scale.        The family's lone survivor was Khodzharayev's 6-day-old girl, who had not yet been named. She was held aloft by her father at arm's length, escaping the torrent of wet, sticky clay, said Kholmurod Barotov, 17, a bakery worker.
