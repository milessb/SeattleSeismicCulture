More than 10,000 people were killed in an earthquake that devastated parts of northwest Iran today, Iran's official news agency IRNA said.        Official news reports, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, said about 5,000 were injured.        Many hundreds more were reported missing in the rubble of collapsed buildings and the death toll was expected to rise considerably.        In Geneva, the U.N. Disaster Relief Organization said today that the death toll was as high as 3,710. In a statement, it gave no details on the death toll and cited only ``local reports.''        The Geophysics Center at Tehran University said the quake measured 7.3 on the Richter scale of ground motion. The U.S. Geological Survey measured it at 7.7.        The Tehran center recorded 12 aftershocks after the early morning quake, IRNA reported.        The quake struck at 12:30 a.m., when most people were either sleeping or watching World Cup soccer on television. IRNA quoted the Geophysics Center as saying it was centered 125 miles northwest of Tehran, near the Caspian Sea.        The quake also rattled the bordering Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, slightly damaging some old buildings in its capital of Baku but causing no casualties, the Soviet news agency Tass said.        The quake killed at least 1,600 people and injured 3,600 in Iran's Zanjan province, and killed 300 and injured more than 1,000 in Gilan province, IRNA. It said the dead included at least 1,000 people killed in one large village in Zanjan province, Ab-Dar, the agency said. At least 88 people were killed in Qazvin just 80 miles northwest of Tehran.        IRNA reported ``massive destruction.'' It said homes crumbled and landslides loosed by the shock were blocking main roads, hampering rescue efforts.        The mountainous, largely agricultural provinces have a combined population of 2.7 million and the news agency said several villages near the 100,000-resident provincial capital of Zanjan were destroyed.        Tehran residents said the quake shattered windows and sent people fleeing into the streets. They reported no casualties or    serious damage in the capital.        ``It was like a rocking motion,'' said a longtime resident of Tehran, speaking by telephone on condition he not be identified further.        IRNA said the Interior Ministry had been asked for medical teams and heavy lifting machinery: ``An extensive relief operation has been launched by the Red Crescent and local officials to pull victims out of the rubble.''        In Washington, White House officials offered humanitarian assistance to Iran today.        ``We are saddened by the damage and the loss of life,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. He said a message of condolence had been sent to President Hashemi Rafsanjani.        `We are also expressing our willingness to provide appropriate humanitarian assistance should it be requested,'' Fitzwater said.        President Hashemi Rafsanjani declared three days of mourning and ordered all state organs to be ready to aid in the relief efforts. Spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei flew to the area and called the quake a divine test.        ``The bereaved and other people should pass this test with pride through their patience, endeavor, cooperation and assistance,'' he said in a radio dispatch monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.        IRNA said an unspecified number of people were killed and injured in the Caspian port city of Rasht. It said houses collapsed in the Gilan province capital of 189,000 people, which is 175 miles northwest of Tehran.        The agency said the ``exact number of casualties and the extent of losses were still unknown'' and that rescuers and relief teams had set up headquarters in Rasht.        Scenes shown on state television and monitored in Cyprus showed young men frantically clawing at debris from pancaked concrete buildings. Occasionally, they carried away a victim on a stretcher. Bulldozers cleared larger pieces of debris. Women in black chadors camped out in the city's public squares, afraid to return to their homes.        A dam south of Rasht burst, flooding the surrounding area, IRNA said.        Three U.S.-made C-130 transport planes shuttled between Tehran and Rasht to carry the injured to hospitals in the capital, it said. State-run Iran Air ordered special flights to carry the injured.        Russ Needham, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said the quake was centered in the Caspian Sea about 15 miles off the Iranian coast.        Needham said preliminary data put the epicenter 210 miles northwest of Tehran and 160 miles south of Baku.        The region is prone to earthquakes. A quake registering 6.9 on the Richter scale struck nearby Soviet Armenia Dec. 7, 1988, killing 25,000 people.        The previous worst quake in Iran itself, registering 7.7 on the Richter scale, hit eastern regions of the country on Sept. 16, 1978, also killing 25,000 people.    -----------------------------------------------------------    Major quakes    ;     Here is a list of major earthquakes this century, based on the death toll.
