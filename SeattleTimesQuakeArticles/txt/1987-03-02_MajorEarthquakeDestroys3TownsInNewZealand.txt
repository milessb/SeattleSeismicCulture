AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The strongest earthquake to hit New Zealand in 65 years destroyed three towns on the northeastern coast today, toppling buildings, buckling roads and leaving thousands homeless        Civil-defense authorities reported an elderly man died of a heart attack during the quake, two people were missing and dozens were reported injured.        Ewan Smith, head of the New Zealand Seismological Institute, reported the main earthquake struck at 2:15 p.m. today, New Zealand time (7:15 p.m. PST yesterday) and measured 6.5 on the open-ended Richter scale. He said more than 100 aftershocks had been recorded, with the largest measuring 4.5 on the Richter scale. Smith said he expected aftershocks to continue for several days.        Worst hit were the towns of Whakatane, Kawerau and Edgecumbe, where police said 95 percent of the homes were rendered uninhabitable _ many knocked off their foundations or split down the middle.        The ground opened up in cracks, one measuring 1.2 miles in length and 3 yards deep.        It was the strongest quake to hit the area since a tremor registering 6.5 on July 26, 1961.
