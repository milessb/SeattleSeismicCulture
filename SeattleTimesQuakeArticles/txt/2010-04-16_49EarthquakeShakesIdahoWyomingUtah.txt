SALT LAKE CITY â€” A magnitude-4.9 earthquake rattled parts of Utah, Wyoming and Idaho on Thursday night. There were no reports of significant damage or injuries. University of Utah officials said the quake's epicenter was about five miles east-northeast of Randolph, a town about 73 miles northeast of Salt Lake City. The quake was the largest in Utah since a magnitude-5.9 temblor hit near St. George in 1992, according to Relu Burlacu of the University of Utah seismograph stations. Burlacu said smaller aftershocks are possible.
