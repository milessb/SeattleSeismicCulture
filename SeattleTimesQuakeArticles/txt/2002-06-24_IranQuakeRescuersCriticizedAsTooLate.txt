AVAJ, Iran -- Survivors of an earthquake in northern Iran that killed at least 222 people pelted a Cabinet minister's convoy with stones yesterday, saying rescue teams came too late to save many of the victims. The magnitude-6.3 quake struck about 7:30 a.m. Saturday, razing dozens of villages. Waiting for food, medicine and tents, 60 survivors in one of the hardest-hit villages, Avaj, threw stones at Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi-Lari's convoy. "My child died, and the local people helped me to bring him out of the rubble. Only local people are helping," said a man in the mountain town 130 miles west of Tehran. The government said it had pitched about 4,000 tents to care for the homeless and had gotten water and electricity service to most of the needy in the region. Health and rescue workers struggled to treat some of the 1,500 injured and prevent the spread of disease. The Red Crescent Society said about 220 people died, down from Saturday's estimate of 500. But residents in the provincial capital, Qazvin, said they thought the death toll was much higher. The city's governor, Jalaleddin Sharafi, said 500 burial permits already had been issued. President Bush, who had branded Iran part of an "axis of evil," offered aid. "Human suffering knows no political boundaries," Bush said. "We stand ready to assist the people of Iran as needed and as desired." But Mousavi-Lari said Iran would accept humanitarian aid only from U.S.  nongovernmental organizations.
