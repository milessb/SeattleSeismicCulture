ISTANBUL, Turkey - A strong earthquake struck western Turkey today, collapsing buildings already damaged in a deadly quake last month;  at least seven people were killed and more than  320 injured, officials said.    Most of the injured suffered broken bones as they jumped from buildings.    The 2:55 p.m. quake had a preliminary magnitude of 5.8 and was centered on Izmit, about 50 miles southeast of Istanbul, the city's Kandilli Observatory reported. The jolt was felt as far away as Istanbul.    The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., also reported that the quake registered a preliminary magnitude of 5.8, and termed it an aftershock to the August quake.    "It was the strong aftershock which had been expected," agreed Aykut Barka, professor of geology at Istanbul Technical University.  Istanbul Deputy Gov. Ali Cafer Akyuz said three people were killed in the town of Kocaeli when a building collapsed on their car. Another three in Kocaeli died when a building fell on them, he said.     A woman in Adapazari died of a heart attack, state-owned TRT television reported.    Last month's 7.4 quake  killed more than 15,000 people and devastated western Turkey.
