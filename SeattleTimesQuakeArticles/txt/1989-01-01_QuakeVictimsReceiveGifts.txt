MOSCOW - Toys, clothes, jam and other gifts poured into Armenia for survivors of the earthquake that killed an estimated 25,000 people, but the New Year's glee that swept the rest of the Soviet Union was largely missing, Tass reported yesterday        ``Never before have Armenian children received so many New Year's gifts from Father Frost and Santa Claus from all over the world. And never before was this favorite children's holiday so sad,'' the official Soviet news agency reported from the Armenian capital, Yerevan.        Tass said its reporter asked one boy whose mother had been killed in the quake in the city of Spitak what he wanted from Father Frost, the plump, bearded man who brings gifts during New Year's.        ``Let him return my mother,'' replied Armen Kazaryan, 8, who was hospitalized for a concussion.        An undetermined number of children were orphaned by the Dec. 7 quake that ravaged northwestern Armenia. A 40-day period of mourning was declared, so the traditional New Year's spirit is missing, Tass reported.        An International Red Cross official reported that volunteers made sure all 4,500 hospitalized earthquake victims received traditional New Year's gifts.        A party of Armenian, British, Russian, Finnish and Hungarian Red Cross workers left in a fleet of Austrian, West German, and Soviet vehicles to help in the distribution, said George Reid of the League of National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.        Dolls and teddy bears were among the gifts distributed to the children at Yerevan's traumatological hospital, Reid said, while adult patients got gifts from Christmas hampers shipped in by the British Red Cross.        A journalist with the official Armenian news agency Armenpress said authorities called off a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Yerevan for New Year's Eve. The curfew was imposed and tanks and troops were sent in late November to quell ethnic unrest in the southern republic.Caption:  PHOTOAP: A SOVIET RED CROSS WORKER, FIGHT, HELPS DISTRIBUTE GIFTS TO EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS IN YEREVAN.
