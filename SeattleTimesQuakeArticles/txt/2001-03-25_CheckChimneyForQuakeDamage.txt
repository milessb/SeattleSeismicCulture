Even though it may not be evident, damage to chimneys caused by the Feb. 28 Nisqually Earthquake cannot be ruled out, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials are warning homeowners. "In the aftermath of past earthquakes, there have been disastrous results for homeowners who used their fireplaces before having their chimneys inspected for safety hazards," said Diane Offord, FEMA's state coordinating officer. "Homes have caught fire, and fumes have escaped into the living area. Everyone should take the danger seriously." Among the hidden hazards can be cracks between the chimney and exterior wall, or internal cracks in the liner. In addition, visible problems such as cracks, misaligned chimneys and displaced materials, are potentially hazardous. Homeowners can call 1-800-462-9029 to report damage or request a FEMA inspection of their chimneys. (The TTY number is 1-800-462-7585.) For uninsured losses, FEMA disaster aid may cover the cost of chimney repair or replacement and possibly some earthquake mitigation involving bracing, said Mike Howard, a FEMA spokesman. "But this is determined on a case-by-case basis; I wouldn't want to give the impression that everyone gets a new chimney," he said. Nor does aid usually cover the total cost of the loss. In order to be eligible for this disaster assistance, homeowners must register directly with FEMA by April 30. A second toll-free number--800-838-7046--is FEMA's mitigation hotline. Howard  says this is the number to call for evaluation checklists, advice on selecting contractors, do-it-yourself suggestions and information on making structural and nonstructural changes. If chimney damage is found, the municipality where the home is located may require a specific type of repair and a permit for the work. In Seattle, for example, the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use (DCLU) is mandating that the damaged portion be rebuilt with reinforced masonry or replaced with a factory-built metal chimney, said department spokesman Alan Justad. Also, the chimney must be tied to the house at two points, and old or damaged joints may have to be tuckpointed. Justad says homeowners with identified problems likely will have to hire a contractor to design and complete a repair. "Just mortaring the bricks back up is not enough," he said, to either meet code or protect the structure in case of another quake. The city's Web site has information on repairing unreinforced masonry chimneys. Go to       www.cityofseattle.net       and click on DCLU Earthquake Information Center. The number to call for information about permits is 206-684-8850. In other cities, the building departments are the ones to call for questions regarding quake damage and permits. Here are some county numbers: unincorporated King County, 206-296-6600; Kitsap County, 360-337-7181 Pierce County, 253-798-3739; Thurston County, 360-754-3360; Snohomish County, 425-388-3632.
