WASHINGTON _ The Mexican earthquake was a terrible physical blow for a country already burdened by economic woes: a vast debt to foreign bankers, falling prices for its oil exports and a struggle to cut government social spending        Because Mexico owes so much money, an estimated $100 billion, it has been undergoing a drastic austerity program, lowering the standard of living for the average citizen. Imports have been restricted and government spending cut to help pay interest on the debt.        Now, the country must devote part of its scarce funds for reconstruction and rebuilding after the devastating quake that struck Thursday and the quake that followed it last night.        Indeed, the size of the task will not be known ``until the dust clears, literally,'' Stephen Cohen, a consulting economist and professor at American University in Washington, said yesterday.  And, he noted, ``The economy was shaky enough as it is.''        As an example, Mexico had failed to meet the economic improvement targets required by an agreement with the International Monetary Fund and has been unable to draw on a scheduled loan of $450 million. Approval by the IMF's strict standard is vital because it gives a nation credence with commercial bankers for continued lending.        In a carefully worded statement yesterday, the IMF acknowledged that Mexico was no longer drawing funds, saying that countries cannot get money ``for as long as they are out of compliance'' with an IMF austerity agreement. Mexico has failed in its effort to bring down its inflation rate, which has been running at 55 percent annually.        The IMF denied reports earlier yesterday that it had cut off loans to Mexico.          However, failure to get a stamp of approval from the IMF could create problems for Mexico's efforts to persuade commercial banks to stretch out the repayment time for a massive $50 billion in loans due over the next five years. Mexico wants the banks to agree to delay payment on the loan principal until the mid-1990s. The nation was expected to ask for an additional $2 billion to $3 billion in loans, even before the earthquake.        Several hundred banks are participating in a complex negotiation with Mexico to extend or ``reschedule'' the debt. But ``any single bank can veto the thing by saying, `We won't sign until the IMF is happy with Mexico,''' said Cohen.        U.S. banks have a total of $25.8 billion outstanding in loans to Mexico. The biggest lenders are Citicorp., with $2.9 billion, and Bank of America, with $2.7 billion.        The earthquake will provide a ``severe test of a resilient system,'' said Guy F. Erb, head of GFE Ltd., a consulting firm specializing in Mexican affairs.
