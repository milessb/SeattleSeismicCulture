SPITAK, U.S.S.R. - In Spitak, the living are searching for the dead.        One young man walked up and down the rows of coffins yesterday, opening their lids, looking for his brother. Finally, he found what he did not want to see, and at the sight of his brother, he climbed into the coffin with him, ready to join the dead.        Nothing prepares you for Spitak. Nothing prepares you for a small town stadium filled with coffins and bodies left out in the cold. A town of 30,000, surrounded by the Caucasus Mountains, Spitak was a beautiful place to live a week ago, people here say. But then the earth moved beneath it, and in minutes Spitak was destroyed. At least half its people are dead. Eight kindergartens, eight schools, factories for soap, sugar and elevators - all of them are rubble.        On every street, the curbs are lined with coffins and the rubble of ordinary life: a stack of books, a pile of cabbages, a boot, a half-eaten loaf of bread, a torn reproduction of a portrait. And everywhere the smell is of smoke and snow and the dead, rotting in their makeshift coffins of rough pine.        ``In this town, it used to be that when one person died, we all cried,'' said Artavad Kogosyan, a sugar worker who was still looking for his daughter yesterday. ``But now only a few can cry. We have no more tears left.''        Survivors who spend their days turning over slabs of concrete hoping for a miracle are slowly giving up. A woman named Annichka Karapityan stood on a heap of rubble which once was her home, flipped through pictures of her family, close-ups of her daughter, a family outing in the mountains.        ``It all happened in an instant,'' she said. ``A noise, a terrible swaying, and then there was no one.'' All she salvaged from the debris were her pictures and, strangely, a pair of high-heeled shoes, a kind of memorial of long-past family events.        ``I have to leave this place,'' she said. ``There is no life here anymore.''        The Soviet army troops that are organizing the relief effort in Spitak have ordered foreign rescue workers and the townspeople to begin leaving. The army will explode mines under the countless ruined buildings, the hulks that lean at grotesque angles.        ``We are being asked politely to stop working and leave,'' said Norman Roundell, a British fire inspector.        Rescue workers, from Italy and the Netherlands, agreed that it was too soon to leave and destroy the town, but they also said that after a week, it would be a ``miracle'' to find anyone alive under the rubble.        Search teams with tracker dogs from Italy and West Germany told a Toronto Globe and Mail reporter that they had been ordered out.        They said Soviet authorities said they were preparing to blast the ruins and bulldoze the city to prevent decomposing bodies from starting an epidemic.        The Italians said yesterday that they would shift rescue efforts to outlying villages. The West German team was at the Yerevan airport waiting for a flight home.        ``The organization here is just total chaos,'' said Paul Newton, a British welder who volunteered to help in the rescue mission. ``There are lots of bulldozers, but no one knows what to do with them. You know, I've been working here for six months on a British project and I've found one thing: that these are the most lovable people that you could find anywhere. They would give you their last ruble if you asked them. But there's no order here and I think that is killing them. It has gotten till it is almost too late to do any good.''        On Tuesday, rescue workers discovered 10 people still alive in the debris, including an 8-month-old baby who was found in a pocket of the ruins sucking on her pacifier. One rescue worker, a nursing mother, immediately put the child to her breast. The baby is expected to live.        But generally the Armenian earthquake - which ruined much larger cities such as Leninakan and Kirovakan - was unforgiving and surgically quick in Spitak. Everyone in Spitak describes the same feeling, a tremendous shock ``like a bomb,'' the eerie feel of rocking, and then collapse. One woman said she thought fast enough to grab her child by the hair and yank her through a doorway and into the street. But few could think or act so quickly.        Yesterday, a young woman named Larissa Margachyan and her father sat around a log fire on children's stools near the ruins of a kindergarten. Larissa had lost her 7-year-old daughter somewhere under the concrete just 10 feet away. For days, she has not left that spot, sitting and sleeping in a long vigil in the snow and fog.        She had been working her day shift at the elevator factory when the earth began to shake. Somehow she managed to run out the door and into the street, heading for her daughter's school.        ``I was too late and what am I supposed to think now?'' she asked, weeping and directing her question to the sky. ``I must go, I must leave Spitak. There is no town here anymore. Everything is gone. My whole life. The school is nothing more than a grave. For nights, we have just slept by this fire, out in the open air, but we are leaving soon. I am afraid just to stand here on this ground. At any minute, I expect the earth to start shaking again.''        Nothing prepares you for Spitak. Nothing prepares you for a playing field turned into a morgue, the dead stacked on row after row of bleacher seats.        ``This was the center of everything good and enjoyable for us,'' said one boy who survived only because he was running an errand outside for his mother when the quake came.        Outside a Red Cross tent, 30 bodies lay on stretchers. They must wait for hours here. Someone from the town's Communist Party committee must register them, give the bodies names before they are put in coffins and prepared for burial in a field behind the stadium.        No one covers their faces. And the dead stare into a bleak winter light.        Two soldiers from Krasnodar sit near the bodies at a fire, warming their feet and drinking mineral waters from blue bottles. There is something painfully slow about the way the work is progressing here. Dozens of army officers give orders. Many more soldiers sit by their fires ``keeping order.'' It seems only a few people are really working with much purpose anymore.        On the heaps of rubble and in the half-toppled apartment houses, men and women search numbly for all they can find of their lives. One boy who lost his parents in the quake gathered his father's collection of history books. ``He had 3,000 books, he was like a scholar.''        An old woman, wrapped in an army blanket, looks for shoes. Others just stand in the stones, as if they were guarding their family graves.        ``This is what the end of the world must look like,'' said one factory worker. The gathering places of Spitak - the post office, the schools, even the local party committee office - are all turned to nothing by a single moment of geology.        The front wall of the sugar factory still stands, but its long red-and-white propaganda sign - ``Our great perestroika is the new beginning'' - is shattered and slowly falling off the facade in hunks.        Of all the places leveled by the quake, there is something unique about Spitak, about the completeness of the damage and the loss here. ``So few are left,'' one old woman said, ``And a lot of us who made it now cannot stand to be alive.''        All of Armenia is mourning this town and those like it. Along the three-hour drive from Yerevan to Spitak, hundreds of people have hung red-and-blue Armenian flags from their apartment balconies, careful to tie strips of black crepe to the poles.        Despite all the coverage on Soviet television and newspapers, the horror of Spitak is unimaginable until reaching the town itself. Even on a gloomy day, when relief helicopters cannot fly for fear of crashing into the mountains, the road is a wonder, running through a spectacular mountain pass with sharp switchbacks down into the valley. There is hardly any sign of Spitak's tragedy on the road, no preparation. Just a few miles before Spitak, shepherds are herding their goats through small towns that seemed safe, quiet and fine.        But then the signals of disaster begin. First an ambulance marked ``for pregnant woman and birthing mothers,'' then a series of cranes used to hoist the debris, then a few concrete garages collapsed like abandoned accordions. And finally sirens and heavy traffic and in the distance a smell, an awful yellow burning in the lungs - Spitak.        And amid the rubble and tragedy of the earthquake, authorities have discovered 20 more villages tucked away in the mountains of Armenia that have been seriously damaged, while 150 looters have been arrested, Soviet media said today.         The Communist Party daily Pravda said goods worth more than $424,000 had been confiscated from the looters.         It quoted Gen. V. Dubinyak, chief of staff of Interior Ministry troops, as saying, ``We shouldn't conceal the fact that all kinds of scum is coming in search of easy profit to the places of tragedy.''    --  Material from The Associated Press and Reuters is included in this report.
