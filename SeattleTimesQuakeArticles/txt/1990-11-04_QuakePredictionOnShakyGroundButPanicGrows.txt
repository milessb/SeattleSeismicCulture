At first, it barely stirred across the nation's heartland. But last summer its rumbling grew, and in the past month it's become a monster.        It's the Great New Madrid Earthquake Panic, an emotional tremor set off by a Sandia Park, N.M., man's prediction that a quake could rock the nation's midsection within 48 hours of Dec. 2. Recently, 11 quake experts assembled by the U.S. Geological Survey issued a 39-page report rejecting the prediction of researcher Iben Browning of an earthquake along the fault that runs from Marked Tree, Ark., into Missouri        ``Our panel found that Iben Browning's record for predicting earthquakes is about as good as that of someone throwing darts at a calendar,'' said a Geological Survey official, Walt Hays.        But emergency officials say the panel's effort may have come too late. Across the Mid-South and Midwest, entrepreneurs are cashing in on the panic. Earthquake insurance, survival kits and even a $99 videotape of Browning have been on sale in the seven states atop the fault.        Anxiety grew after a small tremor shook the region Sept. 26. And now, even NBC-TV is capitalizing on the hysteria. A miniseries, ``The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake,'' will depict how a controversial prediction of a huge quake comes true, devastating Los Angeles.        ``It's just one more thing in a long sequence of unfortunate events that have done nothing but add to people's concern,'' said Jerome Hauer, Indiana's emergency management director and chairman of the Central U.S. Earthquake Consortium, a seven-state planning agency.        The furor began last fall when Browning announced that he had calculated a 50-50 chance that a tremor measuring between 6.5 and 7 on the Richter scale would hit the New Madrid fault Dec. 2.        Browning, 72, a retired scientist with a doctorate in biology, publishes an investment newsletter outlining his theories on the climate's effect on the global economy. He also claims to have predicted the San Francisco quake and other seismic events.        Browning, who has refused interviews, contends that quakes and volcanoes are set off by the gravitational pull of the sun, the moon and other planets. Those forces ebb and flow in cycles. He theorizes that high periods of tidal forces are likely dates for seismic activity, and he contends that forces will be at a 167-year high, ready to set off quakes, Dec. 2.        As word of his New Madrid prediction began spreading early this year, legends about the subterranean fracture fueled alarm.        The New Madrid fault is one of the most active in the United States. In 1811, it unleashed the largest tremors in U.S. history - quakes that rang church bells in Boston and made the Mississippi River run backward.        Seismologists initially dismissed Browning's prediction for Dec. 2 as unworthy of serious consideration. The Central U.S. Earthquake Consortium's pleas for a formal evaluation of the prediction were rejected by the National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council, a USGS-sponsored scientific group.        ``None of us anticipated the high level of public concern it would cause. In retrospect, I think it would have been better if we had evaluated it in the spring,'' said Arch Johnston, a member of the national council and head of Memphis State University's Center for Earthquake Research in Memphis, Tenn.        By summer, prediction furor was so high that some school districts canceled classes for early December. Emergency officials saw demand for quake information skyrocket, and many planned disaster drills near the predicted date to ease fear.            As officials scrambled, earth scientists fumed that the hype was being fanned by one of their own, a Missouri geologist, David Stewart.        Stewart, director of the Center for Earthquake Studies at Southeast Missouri State University, began touting Browning's theories after visiting him and writing a memo praising his theories early last summer.        In interviews published nationwide, Stewart said he didn't fully understand Browning's prediction but couldn't discount it because Browning's earlier earthquake calls had been ``verifiable home runs.''        Goaded by regional alarm and Stewart's persistent, public support of Browning, the Central U.S. Earthquake Consortium in July again pleaded for scientific help.        Finally, the Geological Survey ordered a study of the prediction. Experts huddled in September in Dallas to study it, and the result was unveiled Oct. 18 in St. Louis: Both Browning's prediction and his purported track record were debunked.        ``Most of his claimed successes are actually what I call post-dictions,'' Johnston said. ``When you examine his record, it just doesn't hold up.''        Browning refused to provide data for the study, stating in a brief letter that he was too busy and believed that the panel shouldn't form any policy because ``the government has an unblemished record of screwing up everything it touches.''        Hauer hopes that the evaluation will quell regional fears, but he and others concede that it may be too late.        Worst of all for the jittery region, Browning has made another prediction. In an interview broadcast recently by a Cape Girardeau, Mo., TV station, he warned that if a quake doesn't hit Dec. 2, it might hit on New Year's Eve.
