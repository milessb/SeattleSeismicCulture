Frightened residents spent the night outside after a strong earthquake struck southeastern Turkey, killing eight people and injuring about 40, the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported today.         In Colombia, officials eased their watch on the deadly Nevado del Ruiz volcano.        Turkey's Dogansehir township, 43 miles south of Malatya province, was hardest hit by yesterday's  quake, with six dead and at least 745 houses damaged. Two people also were killed in Golbasi in Adiyaman Province, government radio said, and the Surku Dam was reported cracked.        Government radio initially put the number killed at 15.        The 6:35 a.m. earthquake measured 5.8 on the Richter scale and was centered about 620 miles east of Istanbul, officials at the Kandilli Observatory said. It was followed by a number of aftershocks, the strongest of which hit five minutes later and measured 4 on the Richter scale.        The deputy governor of Malatya, Cezmi Gocer, said that tents to shelter the homeless were sent to Dogansehir.        The Turkish Red Crescent, the equivalent of the Red Cross, sent five shipments of food and clothing, 2,600 tents and 11,500 blankets to stricken areas, according to state radio.        Anatolia reported the Ministry of Public Works sent $22,000 in aid.     Authorities evacuated the area around the dam and reduced the water level of its lake to prevent flooding, the Athens News Agency said, quoting sources in Turkey.        In Colombia, the Nevado del Ruiz volcano appeared to have begun slumbering again after experts had been worried about the possibility of a mudslide.        The volcano 90 miles west of Bogota erupted in November, causing a mudslide that killed 23,000 people. On Sunday and early yesterday it rumbled ominously and belched smoke, alarming officials.        By last night, however, the crisis seemed to fade.
