We wish to extend our personal thanks to Mother Nature for her timely and generous assistance in providing a 5.4 magnitude earthquake while the Kingdome was occupied. Her cooperation helps Seattle effectively refute Seahawk owner Ken Behring's nonsensical contention that the Kingdome is seismically unsafe. Mother Nature's kinetic affidavit will be happily submitted in any future litigation contending that the Seahawks must be moved because the Kingdome poses a danger during an earthquake     Once again, the people of the Pacific Northwest and Mother Nature work together in a common cause.
