BEIJING -  At least 14 people have been killed and nearly 100 injured after one of the worst earthquakes to hit China's Inner Mongolia jolted the region today, officials said.     Dozens of houses collapsed when the tremor measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale rocked the region. The epicenter was  about 335 miles northwest of Beijing, a  State Seismological Bureau official said. The final death toll was expected to be higher.     Authorities had sent squads of soldiers and doctors around the region to treat the injured and assess damage, he said.     Initial reports said most of the dead were in Baotou, 31 miles south of the earthquake's epicenter, and the county of Guyang.     A series of aftershocks of up to 5.0 on the Richter scale shook the region later, the official Xinhua news agency said.    Baotou, a city of more than 1.3 million people, is a major railway artery and commercial center along the Yellow River. It also is a key industrial city, with major iron, steel, cement and textile factories.    The earthquake was felt in much of northern China, including Beijing,  where high-rise buildings  swayed perceptibly.    On Feb. 3, a magnitude 7 quake killed at least 304 people and left 3,775 seriously injured in southwestern Yunnan. A magnitude 6.9 quake in northwestern Xinjiang on March 19 killed 24 people and injured 40.Caption:  MAPKNIGHT-RIDDER NEWSPAPERS: 6.4 EARTHQUAKE KILLS AT LEAST 8, INJURES 100
