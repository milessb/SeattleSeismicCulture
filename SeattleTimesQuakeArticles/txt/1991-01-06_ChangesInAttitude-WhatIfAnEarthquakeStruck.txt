The city government and Metro did not cover themselves with glory during the great snow of 1990. Dead buses littered the streets like harpooned whales; garbage was not collected; and worst of all the city's streets, mostly unsanded (never mind plowed), were the most treacherous in memory         Few large Northern cities that I know well in Canada and the U.S. handle winter snows as incompetently as Seattle. Its lamentable performance stems, no doubt, from the insouciant attitude of the bureaucratic elite that runs this town: ``Since major snowfalls don't happen very often, let the citizens suck up the inconveniences and the dangers when they do. No need to invest big bucks in an infrastructure to protect the people and to save the city from a general paralysis.''         Well, we don't have large earthquakes very often, either. But if the city's response to a minor snow crisis is any example, I can't imagine the chaos that would follow a 6.5 shake on the Richter scale. This prospect gives me pause. We do, after all, live in one of the most seismically active regions of the nation.         Come on, you guys in City Hall, give us Seattleites some reasons for confidence in you - we're paying the bills.    - William G. Scott, Seattl
