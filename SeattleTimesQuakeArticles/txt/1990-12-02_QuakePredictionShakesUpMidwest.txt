ST. LOUIS - For years, a small number of seismologists and emergency officials tried without success to make people in the Midwest think about the dangers of earthquakes.        Now, thanks to a forecast by a scientist in New Mexico, residents in seven states can't stop talking about The Big One. As it turns out, that hasn't been such a great thing either, some experts say.        The attention continued yesterday as Missouri National Guard helicopters practiced scouting for damage and emergency officials in Arkansas opened sealed information packets as part of earthquake disaster drills.        Missouri officials said it was coincidence that their drill was planned for this weekend, when Iben Browning projected a 50-50 chance for a major earthquake on the New Madrid Fault.        In suburban St. Louis, Boy Scouts at a crafts show took advantage of earthquake phobia and sold first-aid kits instead of candy bars to raise money for their troop.        ``We figured these would be easy to sell since the earthquake is supposed to be coming, and everyone's getting all upset about it,'' said Phil Blanton, a Scout from St. Charles.        Nearby, students at a high school set up boxes of various shapes and sizes to simulate fallen telephone poles, crumbled concrete posts and other rubble that rescue squads and search dogs would have to hunt through during a disaster drill.        They also gathered fake blood and other items to simulate injuries: Plexiglas for glass shards that will be ``impaled'' in bodies, broken bones and makeup for bruises.        In Memphis, Tenn., the largest city closest to the fault, even churches have contributed to    quakemania.        A sign outside St. John's United Methodist Church advertises the title of today's sermon, ``When will it happen?'' and the Rev. Frank McRae wants people to assume he's preaching on the earthquake.        ``But, of course, this is the first Sunday in Advent. This is the coming of Christ. . . . The Advent is not the advent of the earthquake, but there are some parallels,'' he said.        Ever since Browning projected the major earthquake to hit today or tomorrow on the New Madrid Fault, earthquake fears have been rising.        The fault runs from Marked Tree, Ark., northeast through Missouri to Cairo, Ill. The last major quake on the fault occurred in 1895. Temblors in 1811 and 1812 are considered among the worst in the country.        Earthquake experts from around the country have strongly discounted Browning's projection; they say it might just as well have been reached by tossing darts at a calendar.        The 72-year-old Browning of Tijares, N.M., is chief scientist for Summa Medical Corp., an Albuquerque biotechnology research and development company.        He has a doctorate degree in physiology and bachelor's degrees in physics and math. He has studied climatology and publishes ``The Browning Newsletter'' on world climates. Browning bases his projection on the tidal forces and says those forces will be the strongest that they've been in 60 years.        Seismologists estimate the chance of a quake that could cause widespread damage in the seven-state region - Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, Illinois and Indiana - within the next 15 years at less than 10 percent.        Initially, many state and local officials were pleased to see all the interest in the subject, but now some of them are unhappy.        ``He (Browning) has caused us undue hardship,'' said Charles Walker, operations officer with the Missouri Emergency Management Agency. ``I wish the panic had not gone along with the preparedness.''        Walker said the forecast had seriously disrupted Missouri's plans to respond to earthquakes and other disasters because his staff had spent all of its time answering telephone calls.        Federal earthquake officials say they've never seen an earthquake forecast become so entrenched and prompt so much planning.        ``It may be because it's the first time someone has predicted one in the Midwest or it may be because of Browning's scientific background,'' said Virgil Frizzell, a spokesman for the U.S. Geological Survey's Office of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Engineering.        Frizzell said it was impossible to prove to the public that an earthquake is not going to occur in the next few days, even though it's incredibly unlikely.
