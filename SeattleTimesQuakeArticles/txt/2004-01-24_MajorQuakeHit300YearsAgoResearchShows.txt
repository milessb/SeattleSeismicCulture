Scientists using sophisticated sonar and seismic instruments to probe a lake bottom near Seattle have confirmed what Northwest Indian oral histories have long described: a major earthquake that struck the area about 300 years ago. The scientists believe another big quake is due in the next century or two. Sediment samples collected from the floor of Lake Washington enabled scientists to pin down the dates of major Northwest earthquakes over the past 35 centuries, said geologist Robert Karlin, lead author of a report in the January-February issue of the Geological Society of America Bulletin. The record created by sediment, laid down periodically over centuries, shows that large quakes — from magnitude 7 to more than 8 — have struck the region every 300 to 500 years, said Karlin of the University of Nevada-Reno's College of Science, who worked with University of Washington scientists. "The last one was 300 years ago," Karlin said in a telephone interview. So the region is due for another in the next century or two, he said. "There's no way of predicting it any better than that." Karlin has been researching the lake sediment since 1986, when he was an oceanography researcher living near the lake's northern shore.
