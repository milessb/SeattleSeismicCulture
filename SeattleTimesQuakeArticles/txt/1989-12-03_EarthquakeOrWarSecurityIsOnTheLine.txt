For nearly a decade, Jim Leavitt has been digging Vietnam veterans out of the emotional rubble of the war. Leavitt, a Vietnam combat vet, is now a therapist working at the Vietnam Veterans Outreach Center in Eugene, Ore        This fall, Leavitt, 43, was part of a 17-member trauma team mostly made up of Vietnam vets that the VA sent to help salvage the shattered psyches of San Francisco earthquake survivors.        Leavitt's dedication to healing grew from his own collisions with the fury of trauma. First he fought the war in Vietnam. Then he brought the war home. For a year, as an Army notification officer in Watertown, N.Y., he rang doorbells and told parents their sons were dead.        Years of counseling Vietnam veterans has taught the therapeutic community that the long-term impact of trauma is decreased if it is dealt with immediately. So, for nine days, Leavitt and the other therapists ran free group-therapy sessions. ``Visually, it didn't look like a war zone, but emotionally it was,'' he said.        Before he even got out of the airport, Leavitt's work began. When the rental-car clerk found out why he'd come, she blurted out, ``We need people like you. We don't need those damn tourists.'' A small group gathered at the counter and spilled out their stories and feelings. ``People were so fresh with shock, they hadn't had time to go into denial,'' he says. ``They were raw.''        Earthquakes, like war, destroy one's sense of security. Among those he counseled, Leavitt says, ``Safety was the big issue. `What can I depend on to give me a sense of safety?' In Vietnam, I knew I could depend on the ground being there. The ground and the sunrise were dependable. But in San Francisco, the ground was not dependable. Their picture of the world had been shattered.''        The fear of aftershocks or the next quake is like the soldier's fear of the next attack. Earthquakes are the ultimate insurgent force, unleashing terrible destruction with total surprise. ``It's unpredictable. It comes from nowhere,'' says Leavitt.        Rage and survivor's guilt are other reactions many vets can relate to, and so is anxiety. ``People were very anxious. In Vietnam, once having experienced combat, there was this hyper-alertness. You're always waiting for the next time. It was the same for the people of San Francisco.''        For many Vietnam veterans, nightmares are a one-way ticket to hell. Quake survivors are no different. ``People have quake dreams and see their houses collapsing,'' Leavitt says. ``One lady had some bizarre dreams about angels coming down and starting to eat her. (Survivors) were going through sleep deprivation. People thought they were going crazy.''        Leavitt stressed their reactions were normal and gave them an idea of what to expect. ``I taught them about flashbacks. They might be driving across the Bay Bridge for the next year and a half and still feel the quake. I hope some sanity will follow now that they know what delayed stress is. I can't give them back their world as it was before the quake, but I can help them hold on to their spirit.''        As a vet, he said there were moments when he felt a quiet sense of vindication. ``There were 36 people in my first group. The soldier in me, the veteran, thought, `You civilians, I'm glad you went through this because now you can't deny my pain.' Tears came to my eyes. But I said I can't let the bitterness control me, so in my head I just flipped it and recycled those feelings and a lot of that pain into healing.''        Leavitt flew back to Oregon from San Francisco flushed with the feeling that he had finally come to terms with the war.        What made the difference was the gratitude he felt from the earthquake survivors. ``After doing these groups, people would come up and embrace me and say, `Thank you for being who you are.' It was like I returned home and got that public recognition, that welcome that I've been yearning for for years. They validated me and thanked me.''        ``Now it's all come full cycle. That horrible experience of Vietnam does teach. I have turned it around. I got my welcome home, 20 years later.''    (Copyright, 1989, Laura Palmer. Distributed by Tribune Media Services Inc.)
