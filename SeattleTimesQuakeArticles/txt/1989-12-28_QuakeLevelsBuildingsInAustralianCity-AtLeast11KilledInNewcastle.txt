NEWCASTLE, Australia - A strong earthquake today crumbled buildings and homes in this southeastern city, killing at least 11 people and injuring more than 120, officials said. The army was called in to help prevent looting         Some reports said  30 people died in Newcastle, an industrial hub of 500,000 people about 75 miles north of Sydney. Hundreds of thousands of homes were without electricity.         Damage was put at $1 billion in a preliminary estimate.         Crews searched for more victims believed buried under tons of rubble.         The quake, which measured 5.5 on the Richter scale, struck at 10:28 a.m. (3:28 p.m. Wednesday PST). Police said it was the first in Australian history to strike a heavily populated area.         ``It felt like there was someone under my bedroom floor who lifted the house,'' said one Newcastle resident, who reported two aftershocks.         Rescue efforts were concentrated on the Newcastle Workers Club, a major social center for the city's steel, coal and shipbuilding workers. When the quake struck the center was bustling with elderly regulars at the weekly bingo session.         At least eight people died when the walls collapsed, police spokesman Simon Latimer said.         There could be at least another six still trapped in the building, Latimer said.         Police said 122 people were injured, 15 seriously, when buildings collapsed, roof tiles crashed into busy streets and steel storefront awnings fell.         ``I saw at least six people lying in the road,'' said a shocked emergency worker in Newcastle. ``As we looked back, we could see destruction all around us. The second story of the car park also gave way, bringing the structure down and crushing scores of cars.''         Prime Minister Bob Hawke visited the scene and warned that looters would be punished.         Latimer said 200 soldiers were called into Newcastle  to help police patrols.         The city center and large areas of the inner suburbs were closed to traffic as police and volunteers staffed intersections left without traffic lights by power failure.         Gas and water repair crews roamed the city, ripping up streets and gardens to repair burst pipes, while nearby on the main beaches vacationers  continued surfing and sunbathing.     Newcastle, Australia's sixth-largest city, is a major shipping port and coal-mining center on the southeast coast.         Many buildings were reduced to rubble. The Newcastle Hospital reported major structural damage, and doctors treated the injured on the grass outside.         The quake was felt across New South Wales, Australia's most populous state.         In Canberra, a spokesman for the Australian Seismological Center put the quake's epicenter at 50 miles northwest of Sydney.         Vicki Klein, a seismologist at the center, said: ``If the quake had struck right in Sydney it would have brought down (high-rise) buildings. They are simply not built to withstand something of this magnitude.'Caption:  AP: THE EARTHQUAKE CAUSED THE ROOF OF THE NEWCASTLE WORKERS CLUB TO COLLAPSE.REUTERS: THE QUAKE LEFT A JUMBLE OF OVERTURNED VEHICLES IN THE PARKING LOT OF THE NEWCASTLE WORKERS CLUB.
