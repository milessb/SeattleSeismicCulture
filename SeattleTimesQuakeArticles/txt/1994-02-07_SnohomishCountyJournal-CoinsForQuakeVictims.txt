Coins for quake victims: The pennies,  nickels and dimes collected by area students already have added up to $2,000 in aid for victims of the Los Angeles earthquake.     Mukilteo Elementary has contributed $1,000 to the Red Cross for earthquake relief, and Heatherwood Middle School, Monroe Elementary and Martha Lake Elementary also are participating.     The schools are collecting donations at sporting events, in their homerooms and during lunch. They have a goal of $15,000 or more.
