OAKLAND, Calif. - Robert Middleton stood by a pavement crack left by the earthquake along the wharf on the Port of Oakland's Seventh Street Public Container Terminal and took a line from a watch commercial        ``The Port of Oakland: It takes a licking, but keeps on ticking,'' said Middleton, a port spokesman.        Officials are still totaling up the damage from last week's earthquake, but it appears that the port - the nation's fourth-largest and the biggest in the Bay Area - suffered about $70 million worth of damage, said James O'Brien, executive director of transportation services for the port.        Most of that can be accounted for at the Seventh Street terminal, which also accounted for about 7 percent of the 14.7 million revenue-tons of cargo that moved through the port last year.        The terminal's three huge container cranes can't run up and down the wharf because their tracks were knocked off level by the quake. It isn't known when they will be ready to go again.        However, nine other terminals remain in operation, and port officials have been berthing ships normally handled at Seventh Street at other terminals so they won't have to be turned away.        ``At the moment, we have the capacity to accommodate all our present customers with a lot of cooperation,'' O'Brien said. ``We are not out to bring in any new users at this point until we get the Seventh Street facility back on line.''        With news of the earthquake flashed around the world, the port is working to maintain the confidence of its shippers through representatives in Rotterdam, Hong Kong, Taipei, Tokyo and Seoul.        Reports of heavy congestion around Los Angeles during the 1984 Olympics caused some shippers to divert cargo to Oakland, and now Oakland hopes to escape having the tables turned, Middleton said.        The Port of Oakland serves about 1,500 ships a year, and 88 percent of the cargoes come in containers. Oakland handles 90 percent of the container cargo moving through the Golden Gate.        Cargoes going out tend to be raw materials, agricultural goods and partially finished goods. Cargoes coming in tend to be consumer goods. About 90 percent of the shipping is on the Pacific Rim, though some comes from Europe and South America.        The same seismic forces that swayed the Bay Bridge so much that a section of the upper deck fell also hit the 20-year-old Seventh Street Terminal, heaving up a big crack where the wharf, supported by concrete pilings driven down to bedrock, meets the yard, which rests on fill.        The jolt shook the wharf, shearing off the row of batter piles at the top, he said. The batter piles are sets of two diagonal concrete pilings that come together like an A-frame. Forming a row farthest from the water side of the wharf, they were designed to protect the wharf from the sideways shake of an earthquake.        When they failed, the wharf tilted, lowering the crane tracks on the water side several inches - enough to put the cranes out of commission.        The wharf probably will have to be replaced, and there is no telling how long that will take, said Steve Kappler, civil engineer for the port.        But it offers a lesson to engineers on how to build a wharf to withstand an earthquake.        The wharf stood up at the Howard Terminal, which was built in 1980 with the benefit of more advanced knowledge of earthquake engineering, though a container crane was knocked off its tracks.Caption:  PHOTOAP: A SURVEYOR CHECKS SOME OF THE EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND.
