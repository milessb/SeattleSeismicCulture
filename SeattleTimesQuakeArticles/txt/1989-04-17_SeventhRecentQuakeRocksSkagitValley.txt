Seventh recent    quake rocks    Skagit Valley    --  SEATTLE         A loud boom and rumble yesterday morning accompanied another earthquake east of Mount Vernon. The quake was the seventh one to be reported in the Skagit Valley in the past two months         The quake caused no damage or injuries and measured 3.0 on the Richter scale. Seismologists at the University of Washington said the quake hit at 8:35 a.m. and was centered in the Big Lake area, which has had at least two other quakes this year.         ``We're getting kind of used to it, I guess,'' said Tim Woiwod, owner of Big Lake Grocery. ``There was a loud boom and a slight jar.''         Earthquakes measuring between 2.6 and 4.0 have been reported in the Skagit Valley since mid-February. A quake of 3.5 is usually capable of causing slight damage. Every increase of one number on the Richter scale means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 4.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 3.5.
