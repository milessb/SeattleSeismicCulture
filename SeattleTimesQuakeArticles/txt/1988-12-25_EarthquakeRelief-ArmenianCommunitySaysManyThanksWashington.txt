The Armenian community extends its heartfelt thanks to Washingtonians for your overwhelming generosity in helping the victims of the earthquake in Armenia. Your cash contributions provided urgently needed medical supplies for the King County disaster team, the first U.S. medical personnel permitted to enter Armenia to give aid to the injured. Without you, it could not have been done         Your donations of clothing have been packaged and stored until we receive official clearance for shipment.         We are still in desperate need of cash donations and volunteers. The collection of clothing has been temporarily suspended. You may write checks to ``The Armenian Church of Seattle/Earthquake Fund,'' P.O. Box 1266, Mercer Island, Wash. 98040.         Volunteers may contact the King County Disaster Relief Team at 363-1776. Our new hotline for information: 838-7300 (days); 236-1518 (evenings).         On behalf of the Armenian church of Seattle and the Armenian cultural organization of Washington, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. May God bless you all.    - Kirk Ohanessian, council chairman    Armenian Church of Seattle    - Aida Kouyoumjian, president    Armenian Cultural Associatio
