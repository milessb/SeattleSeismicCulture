As fate would have it, a seven-year civil war and the grinding poverty endemic to Central America have not been enough punishment for tiny El Salvador, whose capital city has been hit by one of the great natural catastrophes of the decade     The earthquake that shook San Salvador last week has left many hundreds dead, 10,000 injured, 100,000 jobless and more than 300,000 homeless. President Jose Napoleon Duarte says virtually the whole city will have to be reconstructed.     Obviously, El Salvador, which already ranks high on the priority list for U.S. aid, is going to need a great deal more of it. One hopes for a generous response also from Western Europe and Japan.     Monsignor Arturo Rivera y Damas, Roman Catholic archbishop of San Salvador, has expressed hope that the disaster might encourage the guerrillas and the government to end the war.     The rebels announced a unilateral temporary cease-fire, but Duarte, calling them terrorists, refused to take the same step. He ought to reconsider. The rebels may not be trustworthy. But in the aftermath of the great national tragedy, it would be an act of statesmanship to respond to the archbishop's plea and give the suffering country a taste of peace.
