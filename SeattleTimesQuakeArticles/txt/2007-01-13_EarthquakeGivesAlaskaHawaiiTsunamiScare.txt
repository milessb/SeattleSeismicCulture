ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Tsunami advisories were canceled today in Alaska and Hawaii after officials determined waves from a powerful earthquake in the northern Pacific were too small to pose a threat. A tsunami of less than 4 inches was recorded Friday night at Shemya, Alaska, at the western end of the Aleutians, the National Weather Service said. The warning prompted more than two dozen people on a remote Aleutian island to take refuge in an underground shelter. "It's one of those situations where the indications are, when you look at Shemya and the other places in Japan, it really doesn't meet the criteria to be destructive," said National Weather Service spokesman Greg Romano. An 8.2-magnitude earthquake struck off Japan's northern coast in the Pacific today. Japan's Meteorological Agency said a small tidal swell hit near the town of Nemuro in northeastern Japan more than an hour after the quake. Most areas reported there had been no visible change to the sea level. The quake struck about 310 miles east of Etorofu, the largest of a disputed four-island chain known as the Northern Territories in Japan and the Kuril islands in Russia. The quake struck 19 miles below the seabed, the agency said. The U.S. Geological Survey registered the earthquake with a magnitude of 8.2. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage from the quake. Tsunami waves — generated by earthquakes — are often barely noticeable in the ocean but can rise to great heights once they arrive at shore. On Dec. 26, 2004, a magnitude-9.0 earthquake off Indonesia's Sumatra island spawned giant waves that fanned out across the Indian Ocean at jetliner speeds, leaving at least 230,000 dead and millions homeless. The Japanese meteorological agency also issued warnings last November following a magnitude-7.9 quake in a similar area, but most areas saw waves of only about 7.8 inches.
