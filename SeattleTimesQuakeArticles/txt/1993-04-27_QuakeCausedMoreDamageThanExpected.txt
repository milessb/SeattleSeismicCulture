PORTLAND      Last month's earthquake caused more damage than expected for a quake of its magnitude, a state geologist said yesterday.     The March 25 quake measured 5.6 on the Richter scale and was centered in a previously unknown fault area near Scotts Mills, 35 miles south of Portland.     Preliminary mapping shows the most extensive damage occurred in an oblong-shaped area running southeast to northwest from Scotts Mills to Newberg.    Geologist Ian Madin said the extent of damage in Newberg, 28 miles from the epicenter, was a surprise. Damage occurred in at least 90 buildings in Newberg, according to an assessment published in the May issue of the journal Oregon Geology.    The quake also caused extensive damage in Molalla and Mount Angel, nearer to the epicenter, and rocked the 55-year-old state Capitol in Salem, 20 miles away. Total damage is estimated at $28 million to $30 million.    Madin, a seismic-hazards geologist, said soil conditions probably contributed to the extensive damage. A layer of soft sand, silt and clay on top of hard rock can amplify an earthquake's power, he said.
