SAN FRANCISCO - The devastating earthquake that hit the Bay area damaged and may have destroyed two local sports dreams.        The proposition for a new downtown baseball park, already trailing narrowly in early October polls, faces even longer odds in the Nov. 7 election with voters reeling from the estimated $2.5 billion in damage wreaked upon the city by the Oct. 17 quake. The drive to bring the football Raiders back to quake-ravaged Oakland from Los Angeles also faces a cloudy future.        Both proposals, hinging on strong last-minute pushes by officials of the cities, have been     shelved while the daunting task of rebuilding crumbled roads, buildings and neighborhoods takes priority.        ``It is certainly a very difficult time to convince the public to support investments in sports when clearly resources need to be invested to rebuild the two cities,'' San Francisco political consultant Paul Ambrosino said.        Timing is critical to both projects.        San Francisco city and private backers of Proposition P, including Mayor Art Agnos, are not now planning to resume the blitz of radio advertising, mailers and telephone calls to voters that they'd claimed was boosting the ballpark measure's standing in the polls.        ``There will be no ballpark campaign . . . until the mayor decides it is worthy of either his or the public's attention,'' said Richie Ross, a close Agnos adviser who helped formulate the ``Yes on P'' strategy. ``Whether or not he decides (that) prior to the election is a judgment he will make.''        The mayor brushed aside a question about the stadium campaign at a World Series press conference last week, saying, ``Proposition P has not been something I've even thought about.''        Raider majority owner Al Davis has indicated that he, too, is on the verge of a final decision on the franchise's future home. But the Oakland City Council has yet to join the Alameda County Board of Supervisors in endorsing a relocation plan. A meeting on the proposal was called off after the earthquake.        ``There has not been any private or public discussion about the proposal'' since the Oct. 17 quake, Oakland City councilman Wilson Riles said Tuesday.        ``If it's a matter of spending even one dime of public money, yes, it's in bad shape,'' he said. ``The need to keep any kind of plan from impacting public dollars obviously is even more important now.''        Ambrosino, who is not directly involved in either project, said there are almost certainly too many question marks for either one to gain approval in the immediate future.        ``The price tag on earthquake repair is still unknown,'' he said. ``It makes it very difficult for voters to consider other investments. They just aren't going to be willing to listen to arguments about spending money on other things.        ``That may change in a few months,'' the consultant said, ``but not in the next few weeks.''        The ballpark measure appears to be in the bigger trouble of the two. It calls for a $96 million, 45,000-seat stadium to be constructed as a replacement for windy Candlestick Park on the city's China Basin waterfront. That area is built on landfill similar to the foundation of the quake-devastated Marina district, although it was virtually unharmed in the 6.9 temblor.        ``Even before the earthquake, people were more inclined to fix Candlestick than to see millions spent on a new ballpark,'' said Ambrosino, who conducted a poll on the issue in August. ``You call people up to pitch a new ballpark now and and they'll say, `What, are you kidding?' ''        San Francisco voters have rejected other stadium proposals in the past because of the involvement of public monies. Proposition P, to be privately financed, would limit but not eliminate the city's risk through a complex package that involves swapping land, investing up to $40 million in public money and issuing another $50 million tax-exempt bond.        The Raiders' proposal, meanwhile, entails a $257 million offer - $55 million in cash and a similar amount in improvements to the Oakland Coliseum - that supporters claim would not involve taxpayers' money if games are well-attended. It would be financed by the sale of $126 million in revenue bonds to be repaid within 10 years by ticket sales.        Ambrosino, who polled Oakland residents six weeks ago, and found 60 percent in favor of the Raider deal, thinks it still has a chance to gain public approval with an ironclad assurance eliminating the risk of public funds.        ``It's not a big capital outlay, necessarily, to bring the Raiders back,'' the consultant said.        Another major snag that could quash the proposal is opposition by the Oakland Athletics, who would have to share the Coliseum playing field and compete for sports dollars with the Raiders. Talks involving officials of the A's, Raiders and Coliseum have been put on hold until after the World Series.        ``The deal, the way it is now, the A's are going to leave,'' an unnamed Coliseum board member told The (Oakland) Tribune this month.
