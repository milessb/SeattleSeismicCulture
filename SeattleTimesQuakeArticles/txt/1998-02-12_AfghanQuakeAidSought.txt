RUSTAQ, Afghanistan - With thousands of homeless people struggling to stay alive in quake-ravaged northeastern Afghanistan, the United Nations and International Red Cross appealed today for $2.5 million to parachute in 1,000 tons of emergency aid.    "We can't mess around here. . . . If we don't get that shelter, people will die," said Sarah Russell, spokeswoman for the U.N. in neighboring Pakistan. "We need this money absolutely as soon as possible."     Among other pressing needs, aid workers want to send materials to build temporary lodging for the multitudes who lost their homes in a  6.1 magnitude quake on Feb. 4, which destroyed dozens of mountain villages and killed at least 4,500 people.    By late today, a three-truck U.N. convoy rumbled into the city of Rustaq.  It had left a neighboring province four days earlier but was stalled in snow-clogged mountain passes.    The trucks brought 20 tons of food, clothing and plastic sheeting, said Anis Haider of the World Food Program in Pakistan.    By afternoon, the snow had let up and two U.N. planes carrying nearly 2 tons of food, blankets and plastic sheeting had landed. Two Red Cross aircraft also made it to the area.
