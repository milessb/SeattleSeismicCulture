HARTFORD, Conn. - Property and casualty insurers estimated today that insured losses from the earthquake in Los Angeles on Jan. 17 will top $2.5 billion, making it the nation's most costly quake.     Estimates of total property damage range as high as $30 billion, much of it borne by uninsured home and business owners.     "Approximately 33 percent of homeowners in the affected area have earthquake coverage," said Gary Kerney, executive vice president of American Insurance Services Group Inc. Commercial property has a slightly higher rate of coverage, he added.     The industry expects about 230,000 claims from the quake.
