VANCOUVER, B.C. - The earthquake that shook Eastern Canada and the northeast quadrant of the United States on Friday seems to have jolted the awareness of some West Coast residents.        The regional Emergency Preparedness Canada office in Victoria has had ``a fair number of calls,'' director Fred Cooper said yesterday.        ``I suspect we will be very busy for a while,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``People are calling and asking for presentations and literature on what to do in an earthquake.        ``A lot of people think quakes happen somewhere else,'' he said, but overall, Canada is a quake-prone zone and gets about 2,800 earthquakes a year.        Cooper, who runs the federal government's disaster planning office in British Columbia, said he and his deputy have been occupied nearly full time for the past year with earthquake preparation.        A pilot project has been developed for schools to teach children what to do if a quake hits, he said.        ``The best way is to introduce it as part of the curriculum,'' Cooper said. ``By the time they graduate they will have that knowledge and make their parents aware of it.''        The Pacific Geoscience Center in Victoria, which measures earthquakes, has had no noticeable increase in inquiries since Friday's earthquake in Eastern Canada, ``except we had a quake ourselves,'' said center head Dieter Weichert.        A quake measuring 5.3 on the Richter scale occurred Saturday off the coast between the north tip of Vancouver Island and the southern end of the Queen Charlotte Islands.        A center spokesman said it likely was felt in some sparsely populated areas along the north coast.        Weichert said there is no connection between the Quebec quake and seismic activity in British Columbia.        Scientists say British Columbia is overdue for a major quake between 5.5 and 7.5 on the Richter scale. But Weichert said earthquake prediction is ``a science still looking for answers.''        ``There is no definite precursor that is recognized as reliable throughout the world,'' he said.        The Quebec quake, which measure 6.0 on the Richter scale, caused minor damage. A pedestrian in Quebec City was struck and killed at an intersection that had been blacked out by a power failure caused by the quake.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Each increase of one number indicates ground motion that is 10 times greater.        A quake of 3.5 can cause slight damage in the local area, while a 7 reading is capable of widespread, heavy damage.
