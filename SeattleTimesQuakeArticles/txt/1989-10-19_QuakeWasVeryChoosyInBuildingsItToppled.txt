SAN FRANCISCO - The Marina District is one of those gentrified San Francisco neighborhoods so hip that even the traffic cops drink Evian water.         Its streets are lined with European cars and many of its pastel older homes offer stunning views of San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. But those aren't the views associated with the neighborhood this week. People around the world are instead being presented pictures of 60-year-old houses caved in on themselves and images of wild flames lighting an otherwise dark night.         The Marina District was the favored residential home of the 1989 Bay Area earthquake. Yesterday, as other San Franciscans took on a slightly festive mood to match the unscheduled work holiday, city workers grimly dug through the rubble of one collapsed Marina residence and found at least two corpses.         Of the five or six dozen homes throughout the city that were demolished or damaged beyond repair by the earthquake, a good two-thirds are in the Marina District.         Commentators have yet to tire of telling us that this earthquake was one of those events the exact details of which will be remembered forever by all who experienced it. And in many ways, the Bay Area earthquake of 1989 was a universal affair.         The quake was evident throughout the area - from the alternators and generators hurled to the floor of Honest Al's Used Car Parts in Oakland to the five-foot hole slashed in the dome of the rotunda at the Palace of Fine Arts near the Presidio.         But for all of its universality, the earthquake was a wildly undemocratic affliction. Most of those who experienced it saw it as a brief spike in an otherwise humdrum Tuesday night. One minute they were sitting there tuning in the World Series, the next minute plates and saucers were dancing around and sometimes beyond the bounds of the kitchen.         Then it was over. Maybe they rushed outside to see what the hell was going on and maybe the smooth water of their lives would be disturbed for a week, but the overall flow of those lives was largely undisturbed.         But for some, the 15 seconds of the earthquake fundamentally changed the circumstances and sometimes the existence of their lives. They lost homes, businesses, automobiles and in some cases lives.         For all of the talk about the widespread destruction of an earthquake felt all the way from the coast inland to Nevada and from Los Angeles north to Redding, the major effects of the quake were surprisingly isolated and intense.      Why? Why does a neighborhood like the Marina suffer when its neighbors escape? Why, even within the Marina, is one home leveled and its next-door neighbor untouched?         The biggest determinants are the buildings themselves and the land they are built upon, says Bob Bossi, a structural engineer who spent a good part of yesterday wandering through the Marina District.         Most of the houses of the Marina were built in the 10 years after 1906, replacing the Pan Pacific Exposition that had occupied the site. The exposition had been made possible only by filling in the swampland the neighborhood had previously been.         ``It's not accidental that one of of the streets of the neighborhood is Laguna Street,'' said Bruce Bonnacker, a local architect. ``It had been a lagoon.''         The slightly unstable base the mixture of sand and water created in the Marina plus some unlucky and unknowledgeable design combined to make the area ripe for heavy damage, said Bossi, who has in the past been appointed to California State Engineers Association teams that evaluate structural performances in earthquakes.         Walking through the district yesterday, Bossi noted that invariably the houses that suffered the most damage were on corner lots. Borrowing a New York element of urban design, many San Francisco neighborhoods feature blocks on which the biggest structures are almost always built on corner lots. In the style of houses that predominates in the Marina, this commonly results in a four-story wood-frame apartment building on each corner of a block while the area in between is filled typically with three-story single-family homes.         In the case of both the houses and the apartment buildings, the ground floor was commonly made into a garage.         In the large corner buildings, with their multiple tenants, this has the unhappy effect of creating a ground floor the walls of which are repeatedly cut out to create garage spaces. Each garage represents a subtraction from the strength of the wall.         ``It leaves a massive structure sitting on very thin legs,'' Bossi said.         Such a structure is less apt to resist during an earthquake. The walls tend to begin bending with the movement. As the movement continues, the bending accelerates if the walls are sufficiently flexible - that is, if enough garages have been cut out of the bottom.         What can happen eventually is that the building will whip through the air, its top leaning progressively farther and farther over its sides until it leans so much that gravity pulls it down, crushing the bottom stories.         This is evident throughout the Marina.         In the four-story corner house where city workers yesterday uncovered the bodies, the top floor had crashed with enough force to crush the three floors beneath it, crushing their occupants.         ``The building (top) got so far out, the gravity load just took over,'' Bossi said.         This can be a common problem in the design of very tall skyscrapers. If not corrected, tall buildings can become extremely whippy and unsafe. But contemporary engineers know this and design bracing systems to stiffen high-rises against the extremes of this whipping motion.         As it was, San Francisco's high-rises withstood the quake remarkably well. None is thought to have sustained serious structural damage and only a very few lost windows.         Even older high-rises, which were built without this sort of knowledge, can sustain relatively powerful earth tremors because architects tended to use massive stone in their walls. The weight of the stone added stiffness that is now provided by a bracing system.         The first ``serious enforced seismic design provisions'' did not begin to appear in San Francisco's zoning codes until the 1950s, Bossi said, and by now the codes are stringent about those sorts of provisions. Older buildings are not required to be updated, however, unless the owner applies to the city to expand. If he does, he must retrofit a bracing system on the building.         Most older buildings are never expanded and thus never receive the bracing, which can cost $20,000 on a normal-sized house.         The Cypress Structure - the mile-long section of double-deck highway that collapsed on Interstate 880 in Oakland - suffered from similar design ignorance, said a state engineer who inspected the collapsed roadway yesterday.         The engineer, who asked not to be identified, said the reinforced-concrete viaduct would not have met contemporary building standards.         It was built without joints to relieve stresses that can accumulate in the concrete, he said. Without that relief to dampen its movement, the viaduct apparently began to sway with the motion of Tuesday's earthquake. As the quake continued and the swaying accelerated, it moved out of synch with the moving ground.         ``If they move together, all right. If they move differently, trouble,'' the engineer said.Caption:  BARRY WONG / SEATTLE TIMES: FROM STREET LEVEL, PETER FLORES CAN LOOK INTO THE WINDOW OF WHAT USED TO BE HIS THIRD-STORY APARTMENT ON NORTHPOINT STREET.
