LOS ANGELES - Police stepped in when shoving broke out among earthquake victims in line for emergency food stamps.    All 29 centers handling the one-time food stamp giveaway will remain open until Feb. 7, but 21,000 people lined up during the first two days of distribution. No injuries or arrests were reported. Tent-city count dropping as L.A. residents head home     The five National Guard tent cities that sheltered a high of about 4,400 refugees over the weekend, before rain began driving people back to their own newly inspected homes, were emptying out.    About 1,200 remained in the Guard encampments last night. First $2.5 million in loans issued for home repairs     The Small Business Administration handed out the first $2.5 million in loans to 77 families whose homes were damaged in the quake. The SBA said it received 2,200 applications for the long-term, low-interest loans.
