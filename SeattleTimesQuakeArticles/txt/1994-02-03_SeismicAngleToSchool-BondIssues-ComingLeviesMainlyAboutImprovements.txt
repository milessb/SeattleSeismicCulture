Is your child's school strong enough to withstand an earthquake like the Jan. 17 tremor that so heavily damaged 76 Los Angeles schools they had to be closed?      In Eastside districts, school officials say the answer may be no.     And that's why seismic improvement is a big issue on school-bond and levy issues that go before voters Tuesday.    If Issaquah's $91.3 million bond proposal passes, for instance, Apollo Elementary principal Abby Adams will see $468,000 of it go to strengthen the 24-year-old school's roof.     Another Issaquah school, Clark Elementary, built in 1949, would see its 40-foot brick chimney shortened.    Although the recent California quake has heightened awareness, upgrading school-building safety has been a concern for some time.     Indeed, some schools have already been upgraded to withstand quakes, but much work remains, administrators and others say.     "Only in 1975 did Washington have a uniform building code, so generally, when you start getting before 1975, you'd better look pretty closely at what local codes were in use and what was done in constructing the building," explains Linda Noson, director of the seismic-hazards division of Ratti, Swenson and Perviks Structural Engineers.     In the Issaquah School District, spokeswoman Denise Cozza is concerned about what that means for levy voters. As she points out, people can look at a well-kept school and not see structural inadequacies.     "It's very difficult unless you have a sense of when a school was built and what the construction standards were at the time," she says.     That's exactly what the Bellevue School District learned three years ago when it hired an engineering firm to rate the seismic worthiness of its schools.     Using a ranking of 10 as the best and 1 as the worst, the firm found three schools earned 3s, "and the best only ranked at 7," says Warren Samples, Bellevue's manager of maintenance and operations.     Funding all of the seismic upgrades needed would cost $17.5 million, Samples says. "But in this levy we're only funding about $12 million. We'll be going back to the voters in the future."      The seismic upgrades are part of the district's five-year, $77 million capital-projects levy.      The three schools that received the lowest seismic scores - Bellevue High, built in 1948; Highland Middle School, which opened in 1957; and Newport High, circa 1964 - are scheduled for upgrading.      Other Bellevue facilities the levy could strengthen include Clyde Hill and Medina elementaries, as well as Chinook and Tyee middle schools.     The Lake Washington School District also did a seismic study of its buildings, singling out $5.4 million in projects that need to be completed by 2000.     "We've done $1.3 million so far, and for this next round we're going to be using local (levy) money on 13 schools," explains district spokesman Dan Youmans.   That work would cost $300,000 and be focused on reinforcing six school gymnasiums and lowering or reinforcing chimneys.   If Northshore's $64.6 million bond issue passes, the district plans to spend $5.6 million and $4.6 million, respectively, to extensively upgrade two elementaries, including the installation of new heating and plumbing. They are Westhill, built in 1960, and Moorlands, built three years later. Twenty-two-year-old Leota Junior High would get a $6 million refurbishing.     In each of the schools, the district also plans to reinforce the connections between the roof and the outside walls because the existing connections are not up to seismic code, explains Dan Vaught, Northshore's construction-contracts administrator.     At Leota, there are plans to tie classrooms' overhead fluorescent-light fixtures to the roof frame and to anchor bookcases to walls.     Other improvements are planned to the schools' emergency-lighting and communications facilities so that in the event of a natural disaster they can become neighborhood shelters.     In the Snoqualmie Valley School District, the biggest earthquake concern is a brick-veneer east wall of North Bend Elementary, says Superintendent Richard McCullough. The school, built in 1962, lost its roof during last year's Inauguration Day storm.     "We have a lot of serious breakdown of the mortar," says McCullough. To repair it would take $41,800 of the district's six-year, $1.9 million levy.     Snoqualmie also plans to strengthen Mount Si High School's stadium, built in 1972, and upgrade Snoqualmie and Fall City elementaries, plus Snoqualmie Middle School. The district's emergency communications system also would be enhanced.     In Issaquah, seismic improvements are planned as part of the upgrades of Briarwood, Issaquah and Sunny Hills elementaries, as well as Clark and Apollo. Issaquah and Pine Lake middle schools are also on the list, as is Liberty High.     "The biggest ticket item in seismic reinforcement is the roof structure and exterior walls," says spokeswoman Cozza.     The Riverview School District plans seismic upgrades to Tolt Middle School and Carnation and Cherry Valley elementaries.     Here's a brief rundown of what's on the Feb. 8 ballot for Eastside districts.     Bellevue: Three levies. Bellevue is requesting a two-year maintenance-and-operations levy, to replace its current one, which expires this year. The levy seeks $20.1 million in 1995 and $21.4 million in 1996 for such things as smaller class sizes and classroom materials.      A five-year, $77 million capital-projects levy would include funding for fire safety, improving handicapped access and repairing schools. A one-year levy would collect $11 million in 1995 to purchase computers and rewire older buildings.     For all three measures, the estimated school-tax rates over five years would range from $2.30 to $3.10 per $1,000 of assessed valuation. For a home assessed at $200,000, that would average $580, compared with the current $466 school-tax bill.      Riverview: Three measures. A two-year maintenance-and-operations levy requests $2,795,000 in 1995 and $2,895,000 the next year. This would account for 20 percent of the district's revenues.      A one-year transportation levy earmarks $300,000 to replace three buses, and a $2.5 million capital-projects bond, collected over 20 years, would complete building upgrades.     If all three measures are approved, the estimated school-tax rate next year would be $5.66 per $1,000 of assessed valuation. The current rate is $4.54 per $1,000.    Issaquah: Three measures. A $1 million, one-year transportation levy would buy 11 buses.      A two-year maintenance-and-operations levy to cover existing expenses, including instructional materials, special education and programs for gifted students, would total $11 million in 1995 and $11.5 million in 1996. This would amount to 16 percent of the district's revenue.      A $138.8 million, six-year capital-plan bond would fund construction of a high school and an elementary, as well as provide $91.3 million to repair and upgrade older facilities.    The tax rate for the total bond-levy package is estimated at $5.25 for every $1,000 of a home's assessed valuation. The current school tax rate is $4.87 per $1,000.    Snoqualmie Valley: A two-year maintenance-and-operations levy seeks $4.1 million in 1995 and $4.3 million in 1996, funding approximately 21 percent of the district's revenue. A six-year capital-projects levy, collecting $325,000 annually from 1995 through 2000, would repair seven schools, plus pay for emergency communications and fire protection, among other things. One bond proposal is on the ballot: $3.5 million to build a permanent facility for the Two Rivers Alternative Program.     The estimated tax rate if the total package is approved would be $4.67 per $1,000 of assessed valuation. The current rate is $4.62.     Northshore: Two levies. They are a two-year maintenance-and-operations levy of $19.5 million in 1995 and $21.5 million in 1996, and a two-year, $5.6 million technology levy to install a district library-communications system, among other things. There's also a $64.5 million, 20-year bond issue that would underwrite construction of a sixth junior-high school, buy school sites, modernize and expand older schools, renovate playfields and make safety upgrades.     The combined package is estimated to cost taxpayers $5.89 per $1,000 of their homes' assessed valuations. By comparison, this year's school-tax bill is $5.11 per $1,000.     Lake Washington: A maintenance-and-operations levy requests $26.7 million in 1995 and $28.7 million a year later to maintain smaller class sizes, buy textbooks and supplies, and pay for extra teacher days. A capital-projects levy would provide $55.8 million, or $9.3 million annually, over six years for new classroom technology and facilities improvements.     Estimated total cost of the levies would be $4.73 per $1,000 assessed valuation in 1995. The current rate per $1,000 is $4.40.     The Skykomish district has no fiscal matters on the ballot. Mercer Island voters will decide on a $10.7 million levy March 8.Caption:  PHOTOTERESA TAMURA / SEATTLE TIMES: AS AN EXAMPLE OF WORK TO BE DONE ON A NUMBER OF EASTSIDE SCHOOLS, ELECTRICIAN SAM WALKER WILL BE RUNNING NEW LINES TO OPERATE COMPUTERS,  CLOCKS, FIRE ALARMS AND SOME LIGHTS AT CHERRY CREST ELEMENTARY IN BELLEVUE, WHICH IS CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS
