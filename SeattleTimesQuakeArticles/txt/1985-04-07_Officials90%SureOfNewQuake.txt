SAN FRANCISCO _ American scientists have made what they say is their first official, long-range earthquake prediction _ a moderate tremor expected within the next eight years midway between San Francisco and Los Angeles         The federal and state scientists, after seven years of research said yesterday they were 90 per cent certain a moderate quake would hit the ranch town of Parkfield and register as high as six on the Richter scale.         A quake of that magnitude would cause modest damage to structures that have not been designed for earthquake resistance, said scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Research Center in Mineral Park.         Parkfield, 170 miles south of San Francisco and 180 miles north of Los Angeles, has 34 residents and is surrounded by ranches. It lies on the San Andreas Fault, which crosses California.         Besides studying the earthquake history of the Parkfield area, scientists base their prediction on readings from a number of seismological instruments.         One was a laser device that measured imperceptible movement of the ground as seismic strain increased and decreased across the fault.         USGS scientist William Ellsworth said the most recent earthquakes to strike Parkfield, in 1966, had similar characteristics.         Nellie and Art Claassen, whose 20,000-acre cattle ranch sits astride the San Andreas Fault, were not disturbed by the news about their town.         ``It doesn't bother us much,'' said Mrs. Claassen. ``We set here and watch the land sliding all the time, but we just knock on wood and keep on working. We've been through some hard quakes before, and they don't do much harm. Besides, where would you go?'
