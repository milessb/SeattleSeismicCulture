A 6.5 earthquake hit Coalinga, Calif., on May 2, 1983, at 4:42 p.m. and was followed immediately by an aftershock of 5.0. School was out for the day so none of 1,900 students was hurt. The buildings, however, were heavily damaged         After the quake, San Bernardino County School Superintendent Charles S. Terrell went through the schools and found that the two buildings used for kindergarten had slipped off their foundations and the walls inside the gymnasium were damaged. Most of the large windows in the buildings exploded into the classrooms. ``There were dagger-shaped pieces throughout the room,'' the superintendent said. ``The floor tile and wooden furniture was gouged with flying glass.''         Ceiling tile fell and most of the basements in the school buildings were filled with water when water pipes snapped. All the electrical and switching mechanisms were in the basements and they were destroyed by the water. Natural-gas pipes were also broken but there were no fires. The maintenance people who knew where the shutoffs for water and gas were had gone home for the day and the remaining people didn't known the locations.         In the high-school building, the chemicals in the second-floor chemistry lab tipped over and fell off the shelves. Sulfuric acid and other chemicals burned through the second floor to the first floor. Because the electric ventilation system wasn't working, the fumes went throughout the school.         File cabinets in all the schools flew across rooms and the machine-shop lathes and presses tipped over. In home economics, all the glasses and dishes were broken and the metal glasses stored on top of cabinets in science classes tumbled off. Cabinets that were bolted to the wall, but not to the studs, pulled out of the walls and fell over.         Besides damage to the building, the district found that many children were home alone when the quake struck and now have a fear of separation from their parents, fear of future disasters and are losing sleep. A social worker said the anxiety level rose in elementary schools when a big truck rumbled by the school.
