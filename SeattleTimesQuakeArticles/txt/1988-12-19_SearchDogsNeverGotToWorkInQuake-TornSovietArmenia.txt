Two members of a local canine search-and-rescue team made the trip to Soviet Armenia, only to find that travel delays, snow, transportation and language problems would frustrate their efforts to help find trapped earthquake victims         Dick Reininger of Bellevue and Charlie Ek of Snohomish, who returned home late Saturday, were part of a U.S.-Canadian team of six handlers and their dogs sent to help find survivors in the rubble of Leninakan after the devastating Dec. 7 earthquake.         ``It looked like the aftermath of nuclear war without the radiation sickness,'' said Ek of the team's arrival by bus in Leninakan, once the second- largest city in Soviet Armenia with a population of 250,000.         Floodlights had been brought in by the night Reininger and Ek arrived, six days after the quake. The men describe a strange, half-lit scene with people huddling in small groups around fires.          ``Behind them . . . there'd be a pile of rubble 30 to 40 feet high that used to be a nine-story apartment building,'' said Reininger.         Rows and rows of such apartment blocks made up the city before the quake, he said. People were climbing on the rubble piles searching, said Ek. Concrete dust and the fumes from trucks, buses and cars filled the subfreezing air.         After flying to Yerevan, the capital of Soviet Armenia, the men joined a convoy to ride the 80 miles to Leninakan. As their bus entered Leninakan,  the rescue workers saw lines of people walking away from the ruined city, including ``little old ladies hunched over in babushkas,'' or head scarves,  Reininger said.         ``The overall impression was of a somber, poorly lit, quite disorganized city that previously was apparently the bright point in a very poor part of the Soviet Union,'' said Ek. He described the countryside as similar to Eastern Washington or parts of Wyoming, ``where there is no vegetation, just rocks and dust.''          Reininger praised the Soviet army for helping the rescue team on a couple of occasions, but said local officials, including the mayor of Leninakan, seemed overwhelmed. ``He  was the man in charge, but he didn't know what . . . he was doing,'' said Reininger.         Reininger, 63, the owner of the Eastside Airporter bus company, became involved in search and rescue through the National Ski Patrol. He and his golden retriever, Rascal, are part of the German Shepherd Search Dogs of Washington. There are a dozen dogs in the group, including Ek's German shepherd, Aries. The group gets called out 40 to 60 times a year, Reininger said.         The dogs are ``air-search'' canines. That is, they find people by following their scent on the wind, rather than along the ground as bloodhounds do.         This year, Reininger and Rascal have helped find five missing hikers and skiers.         In Leninakan, however, they arrived too late. The Soviet government was already talking about bulldozing the rubble last Wednesday, the first morning Reininger and Ek spent in the shattered town. The day before, canine search teams from other countries had found only the dead, said Reininger. The Swiss, present with a large team since the day after the disaster, were pulling out, he said.         On top of that it started to snow, making climbing on the treacherous, shifting rubble suicidal, said Reininger.         ``The unfortunate part of this thing is we never got to work at all,'' he said.         Ek, 35, a Safeco Insurance executive, said it was a great disappointment not to arrive in time to help find survivors in the wreckage. ``Personally, I'm not interested in body recovery. None of the dog handlers is.''          Both men voted to stay but went along with the team's majority, which decided to leave when they discovered rescue efforts in Leninakan were coming to an end.         Their job is to work as a team, the two men said. Continuing on their own might have been dangerous. They had been advised by authorities to work in groups because of rumors that Armenians would kidnap them, holding them as hostages so the Soviet government would not bulldoze the ruins of their towns and villages.Caption:  PHOTOPETER LIDDELL / SEATTLE TIMES: DICK REININGER AND HIS GOLDEN RETRIEVER, RASCAL, TRAVELED TO SOVIET ARMENIA TO SEARCH FOR EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS.
