PORTLAND - An environmental group has asked the Oregon Energy Facility Siting Council to investigate the effect a major earthquake would have on the Trojan nuclear plant at Rainier.        Lloyd  Marbet of Forelaws on Board claims there is ``broad consensus among earthquake scientists'' that an earthquake ``100 times greater than Trojan is designed to survive'' will hit the Pacific Northwest sometime in the future.        ``If Trojan goes, it could take everything with it,'' Marbet said.        Bill Dixon of the Oregon Energy Department said, however, that scientists did not agree on the magnitude of a potential quake nor where it would occur, and said there was not enough evidence that called into question Trojan's safety in regard to earthquakes.
