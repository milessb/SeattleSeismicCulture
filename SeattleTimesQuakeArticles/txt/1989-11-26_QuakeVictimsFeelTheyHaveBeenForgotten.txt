WATSONVILLE, Calif. - Day after day, Juan Arellano sits in his blue tent and wonders whether the government has forgotten the poor people of Callaghan Park.        It gets so cold and damp at night, and that's tough on his three children, one of them just a baby. His wife, Alicia, tries not to complain, but ``for anything, now, she gets mad,'' the 26-year-old night janitor says.        ``There are so many people like us,'' Arellano says. ``They can't please us all. So we wait.''        About 1,200 people, mostly Spanish-speaking farm workers, were left homeless by the Oct. 17 earthquake, which damaged or destroyed more than 1,400 homes in this agricultural community 95 miles south of San Francisco. The Arellano home, shared by four families, was among those destroyed.        Portions of Oakland, San Francisco, Santa Cruz and other Northern California communities also were destroyed by the earthquake, which left 63 people dead. But the effects of the quake were especially fierce in Watsonville, where it mowed down block after block of homes and businesses.        Since the earthquake, the Arellanos - there are 19 family members in all - have lived in an unauthorized tent city at Callaghan Park, a tiny city park just across the street from a motel. Arellano looks longingly at the inn, imagining the privacy of its rooms and the warm comfort of its beds.        But he says it is foolish to imagine what one cannot have, and his mind returns, once more, to his home, Tent No. 17. There are about 35 tents jammed together on the grass. In the communal cooking area 25 feet from where the Arellano family is living, an elderly woman cooks tortillas on a donated barbecue pit.        About 125 people have set up camp on this small swath of green at a busy intersection in the middle of Watsonville, a town of 30,000. Hundreds of others are scattered throughout the city, living in cars, on empty lots, in yards, in motels, with friends or in the one remaining Red Cross shelter - a warehouse, actually - at the fairgrounds on the edge of town.        In the weeks since they were driven from their homes, the tent-dwellers have established a small, proud and independent community.        The families are doing for themselves what they have refused to let others do for them. They cook and clean. They have formed committees and delegated chores. And in the midst of disaster, they have made a community out of a campground. The 50 tents are numbered with masking tape and aligned in neat rows and cul-de-sacs. A large, olive-drab tent has been set up as the communal pantry, laden with donated food. Each family cooks for itself in shifts on shared propane stoves and barbecues.         Watsonville is a community still stunned.        The town covers less than six square miles, and in 15 seconds the Oct. 17 earthquake leveled most of the downtown commercial district and destroyed or damaged one in every 12 dwellings.        City officials say it will take several years to rebuild, but for many it is hard to look toward the future when the present is so painful.        Some merchants have mortgaged their homes to buy presents for the upcoming holiday season, and a few have simply closed shop. A great many farm workers are out of work until early spring, when the fields that produce much of the nation's strawberries, lettuce and cut flowers are ready to receive them again. Until then, they make do with unemployment checks or charity.        The supply of affordable housing, scarce before the earthquake, has disappeared. It is common practice for several families to share a house.        The average price of a single-family home in Watsonville is $191,000, while the median household income is less than $17,000. A recent survey showed that one-quarter of the single-family homes here were occupied by more than one family.        The Federal Emergency Management Agency has promised to provide temporary mobile homes for Watsonville's homeless. FEMA has acquired a lot that can accommodate 40 trailers, and the agency is trying to contract for four more pieces of land. The first 40 trailers were scheduled to arrive from nearby Fort Ord, where they are being refurbished, in three weeks.        ``The trouble is finding the space. There is not a vacant trailer park in Watsonville. There isn't a vacant trailer space. It's the sort of thing where you wait for someone to die, it's that tight,'' said Luther Perry, chairman of the Santa Cruz County Housing Recovery Task Force. ``We're really hurting.''        Perry said about 3,000 Santa Cruz County residents lost their housing to the earthquake, and that at least 1,000 people have yet to find temporary quarters.        Late last week, 20 community organizations in San Francisco, Oakland and Watsonville filed a petition with FEMA charging that the agency had discriminated against the poor and non-English speaking, and that it had failed in its mission to provide housing for those displaced by the temblor.        More than 50,000 people in Northern California have filed for disaster relief from FEMA, but only 10 percent have received financial aide thus far. As of late last week, FEMA had paid $6.3 million to 3,400 earthquake victims for temporary housing assistance.        ``A lot of us feel Watsonville has been forgotten,'' said Ruth Lopez, disaster-relief program manager for Salud Para La Gente, a community-based health clinic that serves low-income, mainly Spanish-speaking farm workers.        ``Most of the aid has gone to the (San Francisco) Bay Area as we see it. What happened on the Oakland freeway was tragic, and what happened in the Marina District in San Francisco was tragic, but most of those people were able to rent apartments. They have money, or they have access to money,'' she said. ``Of course, we feel some resentment. To us, this is the Watsonville earthquake. But who has ever heard of Watsonville?''        At the Red Cross shelter at the fairgrounds, 38-year-old Rosenda Martinez walks past a row of 10 cots and a crib, where 2-month-old Luis lies sleeping. This is where  Martinez, her husband, Jose Guadelupe, and their nine children live.        Their three-bedroom rental home, which they shared with another family, collapsed during the earthquake, and Martinez hasn't been back since.        The Martinez family spent the first eight days after the quake in tents at a high school, then moved to the Red Cross shelter after their children began getting sick.        The Salud Para La Gente clinic has tracked an enormous increase in illnesses, particularly among children, since the quake occurred, and health officials blame it on the tough new living conditions and a forced change in diet.        The clinic is serving between 200 and 350 people a day, more than twice its usual caseload. Among the illnesses that are turning up: strep throat, earaches, hypertension, and outbreaks of lice and scabies.        It is warm in the Red Cross shelter, at least, and the Martinez children have regained their health, though little else. Their food, their clothing, their shelter all were donated.        There is no privacy here and certainly no laughter. It is home to more than 250 people.        ``We are grateful for the help, but, you know, we need more than anything privacy, and for the kids to have more freedom,'' Martinez said. ``One woman already got mad at the kids. We're all mixed up here.''        Over and over, one hears the same story.        But the people here are holding on to hope, and to each other. It is all they can do.        Rosa Garcia, 29, came to Watsonville from Mexico a year ago to join her husband of five years, Salvador, a cannery worker. The couple has three young daughters .        Their house toppled onto its side during the earthquake, and now the family lives in two tents at Callaghan Park.        These are confusing times for Mrs. Garcia.        ``I guess it is what you make it. I didn't have my husband for five years, so I am glad to be here.'
