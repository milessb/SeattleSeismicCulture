SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ Amid the death and destruction wrought by Friday's earthquake that hit this capital of 1 million people, a spectacular number of babies have been born to pregnant women in improvised hospitals     ``The shock hurried us,'' said Ana Orellana de Alegria, 22, who gazed happily at her day-old child as both lay in a tent pitched near a quake-damaged hospital.     More than a dozen new mothers slept or chatted on black plastic mats beneath a heavy tarpaulin shelter.     Doctors and nurses said more than 120 women had given birth in tents pitched in the San Salvador Maternity Hospital parking lot following the noontime quake, which killed nearly 900 people, injured thousands and left more than 300,000 homeless.     Dr. Rogelio Ramirez said the mothers were being sent home six hours after delivery, instead of the six days mothers and babies usually remain hospitalized during calmer times.     ``They will be better off in their homes,'' Ramirez said. ``Here, there is too much pollution, dirty clothes and flies.''     Gloria Martinez Hernandez was delivered by Caesarean section shortly before the quake struck and was evacuated with 400 patients from the maternity hospital.     ``The nurse who came to help me out of the building was crying,'' said Martinez. ``I told her to be brave, but I myself needed the courage to get out alive and see my 2-day-old son.'
