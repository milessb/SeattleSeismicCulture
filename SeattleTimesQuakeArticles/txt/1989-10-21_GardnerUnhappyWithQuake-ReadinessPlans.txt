OLYMPIA  - Gov. Booth Gardner said  he's not happy with Washington's readiness for  a major earthquake and will ask the Legislature and federal government for more planning money.        ``Satisfied? No, of course not,'' he said when asked about the state's level of readiness.        Officials of the state Division of Emergency Management said after this week's quake in Northern California that Washington is only minimally prepared despite scientists' warnings that the Evergreen State is due for a major quake.
