The people who make policy and shape opinion in capitals around the world are watching the Iran-contra scandal unfold in Washington with a mixture of surprise, disdain and deepening concern.        From Chile to India, the fast-breaking U.S. news has dominated front pages and newscasts almost every day. In Paris, the entire first four pages of last Wednesday's daily Liberation were devoted to the complex American events. The Canadian newsweekly Maclean's headlined its cover last week, ``Chaos in Washington.''        Unlike Watergate, a largely home-grown affair, the current scandal has had an immediate impact in far corners of the globe by generating miniscandals in a half-dozen other countries, including Israel, Italy and Canada.        However, international concerns go beyond the immediate repercussions of the scandal, which stems from the clandestine sale of U.S. arms to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaragua's contra rebels.        Foreign governments clearly are worried, too, that political damage done to the leadership of the world's mightiest power will inevitably touch them, possibly in negative ways.        Commentators in Canada and other trading nations have expressed the fear that any weakening of President Reagan, a free-trade advocate, will strengthen protectionist Democrats in Washington. Similarly, South African commentators say a Reagan decline could produce a tougher U.S. line against apartheid.        The scandal is already creating new divisions between the United States and its allies.           Last Wednesday, Italy's defense minister, Giovanni Spadolini, bluntly called for a reformulation of the joint Western anti-terrorism policy adopted at the Tokyo summit last May since the Washington revelations show that the Reagan administration was dealing all along with Iran, identified as a state sponsor of terrorism.        The scandal also may encourage such countries as Austria, long under U.S. pressure not to sell high technology to the Soviet bloc, to reassess the value of cooperating with Washington.        In Costa Rica, Nicaragua's southern neighbor, the conservative newspaper La Nacion concluded that ``to sacrifice the anti-Sandinista insurgents because of (the scandal) would constitute a fatal mistake for the United States and for all the hemisphere.''        However, in Mexico the liberal daily Excelsior worried that an ``obstinate'' Reagan would stick by the contras, ``that he is ready to carry that policy to its ultimate consequences, regardless of the probability that such a posture could cost him the job.''        Most foreign governments have withheld comment since U.S. Attorney-General Edwin Meese announced the Iran-contra connection Nov. 25. Aides to Britain's prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, say privately that this is no time to snipe at the leader of the Western alliance.        The Soviet Union, however, has been sharply critical, indicating that the shock waves from Washington may end up rattling the already-shaky structure of U.S.-Soviet arms-control negotiations.             Editorial columns worldwide are overflowing with dramatic commentary on the affair.        One centrist Belgian newspaper likened the United States to a ``banana republic.'' A Dutch paper said the world was witnessing ``the accelerated destruction of Western leadership.'' A government-owned daily in Panama said the confusion and contradictions in Washington are ``bad for all mankind.''        Over and over, foreign editorialists used the words ``hypocrisy,'' ``amateurs'' and ``incompetents'' in discussing the American officials responsible for a secretive foreign policy that has now fallen apart.        The Times of India blamed short memories in Washington.        ``If there was one overriding lesson of Watergate, it was that no president could get away by trying to run a parallel, secret minigovernment, bypassing the established institutions and laws,'' the Indian paper editorialized. ``By choosing to overlook that lesson, Mr. Reagan has inflicted a crippling blow upon his presidency.''        Besides these broad concerns, the Washington scandal has had a concrete backlash in some countries:         -- Israel: Dissident members of Parliament have put the governing coalition on the defensive by demanding a fuller explanation of Israel's role as middleman in shipping American arms to Iran.         -- Italy: Prime Minister Bettino Craxi ordered an investigation into allegations that Iran-bound war materiel was shipped from Italian ports, in violation of an Italian embargo, a charge the government denies.         -- Canada: Pratt & Whitney's Canadian subsidiary has suspended shipment of helicopter engine parts to Iran, pending an investigation into whether the parts were used for military purposes, in violation of a Canadian embargo. External Affairs Secretary Joe Clark declared the Canadian government did not collude with the U.S. in the Iran-arms scheme.         -- Portugal: Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva has twice dismissed reports that Iran-bound U.S. arms passed through Portugal. But he left open the possibility that such shipments were made before he took office last year.         -- Belgium: Belgian newspapers, after the disclosures in Washington, reported that Belgian arms producers have been selling weapons to Iran since 1980, violating an official embargo by that nation. Prime Minister Leo Tindemans has asked for an inquiry.         -- Brazil: The Foreign Ministry denied Brazilian press reports that this major arms-producing nation had sold arms to Iran via U.S. agents.         -- Greece: Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias described as ``fabricated'' a U.S. press report that Greece had sold arms to Iran in exchange for oil.
