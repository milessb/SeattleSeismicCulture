PALMER, Alaska (AP) _ A small but widely felt earthquake shook south-central Alaska yesterday, but there were no reports of damage or injuries, the Alaska Tsunami Reporting Center said.        The 12:51 p.m. temblor measured 4.6 on the Richter scale and was centered about 60 miles west of Homer, said geophysicist John Sindorf.        ``We have reports of its having been felt in Homer, Anchorage, Kenai and the Palmer-Wasilla area,'' he said.
