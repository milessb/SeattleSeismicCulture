The biggest problem King County officials faced after Saturday's earthquake was busy telephone lines.     Many callers were trying to reach 911 and others were trying to make regular calls.     Some reported getting a recorded message that all circuits were busy; others were unable to get a dial tone.     An overloaded phone system kept emergency officials from reaching each other to coordinate efforts for nearly an hour after the quake, said Lavon McCord, director of the King County Office of Emergency Management.     The 911 lines were clogged with 350 calls from people who didn't need emergency help, and cellular airwaves were equally gridlocked, county officials said.     King County officials are considering a system for emergency officials' calls to have priority on cell phones, McCord said
