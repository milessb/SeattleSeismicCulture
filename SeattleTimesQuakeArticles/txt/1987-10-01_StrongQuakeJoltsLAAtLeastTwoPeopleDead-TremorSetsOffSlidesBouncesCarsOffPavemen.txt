A major earthquake struck Southern California this morning, collapsing at least one building, sending cars a foot off the ground, cracking buildings and setting off landslides in the Los Angeles area At least two people were killed.        The quake was felt as far south as San Diego, north to Santa Barbara and as far east as Las Vegas.        Authorities said there were extensive reports of damage within a 20-mile radius of the epicenter.        Initial reports of the quake's magnitude varied from 5.5 to 6.1 on the Richter scale.          A woman was killed when a wall in a parking structure collapsed at California State University at Los Angeles, according to City Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells. The quake also set off a fire at a high-rise building on the campus.            Pasadena Fire Battalion Chief Duncan Baird said a man was buried under seven feet of earth 35 feet into a tunnel under construction and was presumed dead. Rescuers had been searching for him at the site in Eaton Canyon in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Pasadena.        Mark Bennett, assistant chief of law enforcement for the California Emergency Services office, said the agency had an unconfirmed report of a third death, from electrocution.          ``We've had some reports of people suffering heart attacks,'' Wells said.         The first jolt was recorded at 7:42 a.m. PDT, when the city's freeways were jammed with commuters.         Waverly Person, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center in Denver, said it measured 6.1 on the Richter scale, but the University of California in Berkeley estimated it at 5.5.        The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park and California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said the quake was centered 15 miles south of Pasadena in the Montebello-South Gate-Downey area at the north end of the Whittier-Elsinore Fault.           Caltech reported at least 12 aftershocks of more than 3 on the Richter scale, including two that measured 4.4.        Kate Hutton, a geophysicist at Caltech, said that after a quake of this size there is a one in 20 chance of an even larger quake within five days.        (The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.)         It was the strongest quake in the Los Angeles area since 1971, when the Sylmar quake in the San Fernando Valley, northwest of Los Angeles, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale. That quake killed 64 people and caused $1 billion in damage.        This morning, broken glass from thousands of windows littered some streets and there were reports of landslides. Hundreds of police patrolled the streets.        Montebello Police Capt. Ralph Brown said there was minor structural damage throughout the town.        ``Most of the stores in the shopping center have the windows broken out,'' Brown said.        Power to downtown Los Angeles was knocked out for nearly an hour.         An air-traffic reporter for KNX radio, Judy Abe, said, ``All the traffic stopped in all the (freeway) lanes. Quite unusual.''        Drivers said the quake sent cars jumping a foot in the air. Branches of trees cracked and palm trees crashed to the ground.        Burbank Airport Control Tower 10 miles northwest of downtown was closed because the quake shattered all the windows.         Los Angeles International Airport was closed for three minutes while the runways were checked for cracks, said Russ Park, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.       At the City Hall emergency center in downtown Los Angeles, Lt. Larry Townsend said, ``All downtown buildings have been evacuated, including Parker Center, which is the police department. At the time of the earthquake, about 3,000 were evacuated from city-run buildings.''        ``We have no bodily injuries, but extensive structural damage,'' Townsend said. ``There are lots of cracks in buildings. There is glass everywhere.''           Federal, county and city authorities ordered the immediate evacuation of government buildings.          The quake set off a fire at a small shopping mall two miles southwest of downtown, with smoke and flames coming out of at least seven stores in a row of 15 stores. A column of black smoke rose straight overhead in the windless sky.           Much of Los Angeles was in confusion with people packing the streets. But even the streets scared some.        ``I'm scared to walk,'' said Mei Ling. ``Up and down the road I saw the buildings swaying and one man came running shaking like a leaf and all the stop lights were shaking up and down like a leaf.''        ``There are so many fires throughout the city we couldn't count them,'' Fire Department Capt. Donald Cross said at the scene of a ruptured water main at a downtown shopping complex.        Rock slides left boulders on many of the area's major commuter highways, forcing the California Highway Patrol to close parts of the Pasadena Freeway and the San Bernardino Freeway.         Radio station KNX reported the Santa Ana Freeway closed about 15 miles southeast of the city near Pico Rivera because of cracks in the Interstate 605 overpass, which crosses over the Santa Ana.          Power was knocked out in parts of the city and fire companies were placed on alert throughout the city.         Linnea Hunt-Stewart, a magazine editor who lives in Pasadena, said this morning's quake felt as bad as the one in 1971, but it was not rolling like that one.         ``This was a big boom, then massive shaking that felt like it lasted about 15 seconds,'' she said. ``I'm fine, but I was very frightened.         ``The dogs are going crazy, cabinet doors flung open, books are all over the floor, crockery is smashed and I can't call out.''         Joanie Haskell, also of Pasadena, said: ``It was a very violent shake. I've probably felt four earthquakes in my life, and this felt much bigger than any of them. You didn't hear the earth rumble like you often do, it was just more of a shudder.''         In West Los Angeles, Cheri Wilkinson, a paralegal, said, ``It was heavier than the quake in '71, more violent and jarring.'' Books fell off shelves at her house today, too.         Telephone lines were jammed. Repeated attempts to place telephone calls from Seattle to the Los Angeles area were frustrated. Circuits were busy, phones rang and then went dead or callers were greeted with the message, ``Your call did not go through. Please try again.''         In Los Angeles, long lines of people gathered at telephone booths to call loved ones, and scuffles broke out at some pay phones.         Lloyd Darrington, a spokesman for the California Emergency Services Office in Sacramento, said he had reports of ``one collapsed building in the Pasadena area, and there are several fires in the area.''         Damage still was being assessed this morning.        The quake set off seismic alarms at the San Onofre nuclear-power plant 5 miles south of San Clemente but no damage was reported, said Sue Gagner, a spokeswoman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Washington.        She said the plant, operated by Southern California Edison, declared an ``unusual event,'' the lowest level of emergency that nuclear plants report to the NRC, but two of the three reactors at the facility continued to operate, she said.
