Among the better maneuvers at Memorial Stadium last night was Franklin Coach Joe Slye ducking a bucket of cold water that his seniors tried to dump on him after beating Roosevelt 36-21 for a homecoming victory.     "I've still got a couple moves," said Slye, as his football team celebrated its first victory of the season after two lopsided defeats.     The Earthquake (1-2) used big plays early and late to win the intracity KingCo 4A Conference game.     Eunice Palmer ran 66 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter, and Chris Watkins ran 30 yards with a fumble return for the final touchdown and made two fourth-quarter interceptions to preserve the triumph.     Palmer finished with 133 yards on six carries, and Michael Helland rushed for 71 on 13 carries and scored once.     Roosevelt had almost pulled the upset of the season last weekend, losing in overtime to Woodinville 34-27, while Lake Washington was spanking Franklin 63-12.     "They came back from getting embarrassed and embarrassed us this week," Roosevelt Coach Tom Merrill said.     "For 48 minutes, they beat us up. We play good against teams in the Eastside, not Metro now."      Roosevelt is using a lot of spread offense this year, and a key to the victory was keeping Roughrider senior quarterback Zac Corker from having a big night. Franklin's beefy linemen kept him under pressure, and Corker completed only 5 of 15 passes for 42 yards and was intercepted twice.     Slye's sophomore son, Jordan, the Franklin quarterback, completed 7 of 15 passes for 77 yards. He threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to A.J. Snow in the third quarter and ran for a TD, but both interceptions he gave up were returned for touchdowns. Duncan Sherrard returned the first 38 yards for the game's opening touchdown and a 6-0 lead. Robert West returned the second 49 yards for a score in the fourth quarter.     After Sherrard's return gave the Roughriders (0-3) their only lead, the Teds gave up three consecutive TDs to fall behind 20-6 early in the second quarter. They rallied to trail 20-15 before halftime after a 10-yard scoring run by Corker, but never got closer.     The victory put Franklin in the lead for the new Chief Seattle Trophy that will be awarded to the city 4A school with the best record against the two other 4A teams.     The game included one of the season's strangest plays when Watkins made his second interception. There were five penalties on the play: illegal procedure against Roosevelt; offsetting personal fouls against both teams; an additional personal foul against Franklin; and clipping against Franklin, which got to keep the ball.      Eastlake 34, at Garfield 6 - Junior running back Jesse Smith rushed for four touchdowns and 110 yards on 13 carries as the Wolves improved to 2-1. Senior Chris Cappelletti rushed 18 times for 153 yards and scored one TD at Memorial Stadium.     Garfield briefly led, 6-0, after recovering a fumbled punt inside the Eastlake 10. Sophomore Isaiah Stanback threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to basketball star Ed Roy. Stanback completed 9 of 29 passes for 83 yards with one interception and the TD. The loss was Garfield's 15th straight and dropped the Bulldogs to 0-3 this season. Garfield hasn't won since 1997.      Bothell 33, at Redmond 27 - Seth Breckenridge scored on three long plays as the Cougars overcame four touchdown passes and nearly 285 passing yards by the Mustangs' Brian Sheppard. Breckenridge broke loose for TD runs of 55 and 31 yards and caught a 40-yard scoring pass from Kyle Allred. He finished with 132 yards on 10 carries. Paul Balzotti added 142 yards on 15 carries for Bothell.     Sheppard completed 21 of 37 passes, but two interceptions hurt Redmond. Josh Pelham had six catches for 84 yards and Evan Benjamin caught three passes for 76 yards, and both scored TDs for the Mustangs.     At Juanita 27, Woodinville 7 - Woodinville made five turnovers and Juanita's Justin Corbett ran for two touchdowns as the Rebels won a battle of unbeaten teams.     The Rebels (3-0) raced to a 24-7 halftime lead behind Corbett, who had 138 yards on 26 carries. Kicker Mike McRae booted field goals of 42 and 40 yards for Juanita.     The Rebel defense held Falcon fullback Zach Tuiasosopo to 27 yards on seven carries.Caption:  PHOTOROD MAR / THE SEATTLE TIMES: JORDAN SLYE OF FRANKLIN SOARS OVER THE PILE TO SCORE FROM 1 YARD, GIVING THE EARTHQUAKE A 20-7 LEAD IN THE SECOND QUARTER AGAINST ROOSEVELT.
