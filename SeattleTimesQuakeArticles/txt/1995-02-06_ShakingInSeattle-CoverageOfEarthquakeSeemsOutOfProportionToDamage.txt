My response to the media coverage of Seattle's first significant earthquake in 30 years is: "It's a bit much!" All I could do was laugh and shake my head at how bottles knocked from the shelves at a beauty supply store were the biggest story since this daytime trial stared! It is really sad to think that we are comparing a crack in someone's patio to the Grand Canyon, while more than 5,000 Japanese people have died as a result of another recent earthquak     I understand that Seattle is not used to this type of occurrence and that coverage has to be given, but is it necessary to go digging for the same old story over and over?
