MAPUTO, Mozambique â€” A powerful earthquake struck Mozambique today, shaking buildings and forcing people from hundreds of miles around to dash into the streets for safety. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The magnitude-7.5 quake struck 140 miles southwest of the coastal city of Beira, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. The temblor was felt in neighboring Zimbabwe and as far south as Durban, South Africa, 800 miles away. The temblor occurred near the southern end of the East African rift system, a seismically active zone. Since 1900, the largest quake measured on the rift system had a magnitude of 7.6, according to the USGS. Mozambican state radio said the quake was centered near Espungabera, a small farming town in a remote and sparsely populated area near the border with Zimbabwe. In Beira, Tivoli Hotel manager Johana Neves said none of her guests was hurt but many tourists awoke and ran terrified from the building. "It felt like the building was going to fall down and it went on for a long time, the trembling," she said by telephone. State radio said there was an unconfirmed report of a collapsed building in Beira. Buildings swayed in the capital Maputo, 400 miles south of Beira. Radio reports said hundreds of people fled their homes for the street, as they did in Chimoyo, near the border with Zimbabwe. The quake was shallow, which increases the potential for damage, said Dale Grant, a scientist with the USGS in Golden, Colo. At least five aftershocks were immediately recorded and more were expected in the coming days because of the quake's size, USGS said.Caption:  mapThe Seattle Times: Mozambique (GU711IA7J)
