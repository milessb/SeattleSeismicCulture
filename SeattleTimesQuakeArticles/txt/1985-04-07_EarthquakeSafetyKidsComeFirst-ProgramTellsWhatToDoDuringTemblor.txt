It's 10:38 on a wintry Seattle morning. The noise level in the first-grade class at the North End elementary school is intense as 30 children recite the alphabet. Then, a new sound is heard.         It starts as a rattling, like a truck filled with empty pop bottles bouncing along a rough road. Within seconds the rattling builds to a roar.         But the first-grade youngsters aren't listening anymore. Instead they are watching the walls in their 50-year-old school start to weave and the overhead lights begin to sway.        Suddenly, the classroom windows shatter, spraying slivers of glass throughout the room. A file cabinet rocks slowly and then topples. The drawers in another cabinet near the teacher's desk shoot into the room and strike the teacher in the back.         As the powerful quake rolls under the old school building, its brick walls bow outward. Two bricks are squeezed out and the entire wall comes tumbling down. The brick chimmey rocks and falls across the school yard.         By now, the roar of the earthquake has moved west toward Puget Sound and is replaced by breaking glass, falling bricks and bookcases, and the screams of children.         Inside the building, the teachers are numbed by the destruction and the chaos. Some room doors are wedged shut by the sagging walls. Students are trapped. Some have been injured by falling cabinets, lights and ceiling tile.         The school is dark because the electricity has gone off. The principal can't communicate with her staff. The main water pipe to the building snapped off in the basement when the building shifted and a stream of high-pressure water fills the boiler room.         Elsewhere in the city, thousands of parents are recovering from the shock. Their first thoughts are of their children. They race for their cars. Streets leading to the schools soon are jammed.         Police and emergency aid vehicles trying to get to the schools cannot because of the massive traffic jams. Parents have left their cars parked in the middle of the streets after they found traffic blocking their way.         Smaller aftershocks from the main earthquake keep moving through the area, adding to the surrealistic scene: traffic stalled, people shouting, horns honking, sirens wailing and red and blue lights flashing.     by Steve Johnston    Times staff reporter         Earthquakes are a fact of life in Washington and scientists say it's just a matter of time before a sizable temblor strikes the state once again.         Geologists expect an earthquake measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale to hit this area once every 20 years. Some say a quake over 7.5 will hit once every 150 years. A 6.0 earthquake can give you a good rattling, but a 7.5 quake can flatten buildings.         Linda L. Noson knows some of those flattened buildings could be schools _ and schools aren't ready to deal with the havoc earthquakes can bring.         To remedy the situation, the federal government is sponsoring a pilot project _ the first in the country _ to teach students and teachers what to do if an earthquake strikes. Noson, a seismologist at the University of Washington, is in charge of the project.         The last major quake in Western Washington, the 1965 quake that killed seven people and caused $12 million in damage, struck at 8:29 a.m., before most students arrived at school.        In the 1949 earthquake here, however, two students were killed when parts of school buildings fell on them. The death toll could have been higher, but many school districts were on spring vacation when the quake hit. Still, 30 schools were damaged in the state and 10 had to be closed permanently.         The 1949 earthquake set a new standard for school-building construction. New building-code regulations in 1961 made the district build earthquake-resistant buildings. But according to a recent survey, out of the Seattle School District's 159 classroom buildings, 106 of the buildings have structural defects and almost half of the district's 18 gymnasiums have structural problems.       Carole Martens, CQ a Seattle mother who has embraced earthquake safety in schools as a personal cause, is pushing a bill in Olympia that would develop a program to identify unsafe school buildings and have them repaired or replaced.       ``I would rather have my kids go to school in a tent than in an unreinforced building,'' Martens said.       Martens is working with seismologist Noson on the federal pilot program to set the standards for how schools react to earthquakes across the nation.       The program, called Seattle Earthquake Safety and Education Project, is being sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and is being presented this year to five Seattle elementary schools.         In addition to the earthquake project, Gov. Booth Gardner has declared Earthquake Awareness Week, starting todayCQ. Gardner said hundreds of people would be killed in a major earthquake for lack of precaution.         April gets a lot of attention for being an earthquake month, but Noson said she did a study of quakes in the past 100 years and found there is nothing special about the month. April got a reputation for earthquakes because several major quakes on the West Coast have happened in the month. The two major quakes in this state's history _ 1949 and 1965 _ happened in April and a major quake in Alaska in 1964 occurred in April. The Great San Francisco earthquake also struck in April.         Washington has dozens of earthquakes every year, but most of them are so small they aren't detected except by machines at the University of Washington. But when a major quake hits, damage can be extensive. That's what has prompted the earthquake-awareness program in the schools.        ``People like to think that an earthquake will happen on a Saturday afternoon when everyone is home together, but it doesn't happen that way,'' Noson said. ``It could happen when the kids are in school and all the phones go out. What will you do? Are the kids going to released from school? Or will the school buses take them home? Who will they be released to? How will the school communicate with its staff or the emergency people?''         Noson, who is basing her emergency-preparedness project on a ``worst-case'' earthquake of 8.0 or more, suggests that each school have an earthquake kit that includes first-aid kits, communication gear, lists of student names and pictures. Noson said when the phone system goes out, there will have to be other ways to communicate with the outside world. One idea is to enlist the aid of local ham radio operators.         Parents should also find out if their children's school is going to release the children or keep them at the school, Noson said. After one earthquake in California, the roads leading to the local school became jammed with concerned parents trying to get to their children and emergency equipment couldn't get in. California now has a policy of not releasing children until an adult picks them up.         Bob Kirkland, risk manager for the Seattle School District, said the district's existing plans call for releasing the children to their parents after all the students have been accounted for.         The district isn't planning to have the schools ``lay in a three-day food supply'' because the district doesn't expect the schools to be isolated, Kirkland said. But he has proposed that each school be equipped with an earthquake emergency kit that includes first-aid material, blankets, radios, flashlights and a large prying bar that will open jammed doors and lift beams off of victims.        The pilot school project now being taught in five Seattle elementary schools starts with a questionnaire on how much students know about earthquakes and then students are shown a movie on what to do and what not do during a quake. The children are taught about the causes of quakes and what to expect when one occurs. Most students, for example, don't know there is a loud noise that comes with a quake, Noson said.         One of the most important lessons the students are taught is to get under their desks when an earthquake hits and to stay away from bookcases and file cabinets.         ``One misconception is that there is nothing you can do about it,'' Noson said, ``but that's not true. You can teach children ... to drop and cover under desks or in archways or next to inside walls. There are lot of things to be done.'Caption:  PHOTO CHARTJIMI LOTT / SEATTLE TIMES: STATE SEISMOLOGIST LINDA NOSEN, DIRECTOR OF THE SEATTLE EARTHQUAKE SAFETY AND EDUCATION PROJECT, TAKES THIRD-GRADERS THROUGH A ``DUCK AND COVER'' EXERCISE IN RICHARD KEARNS' CLASSROOM.CHART: CHRIS COX / SEATTLE TIME
