MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A moderate earthquake, the second in five days, shook Mexico's capital but apparently caused no injuries or damage.        The quake, which struck at 11:50 last night, was centered in the Pacific Ocean off the Mexican coast, according to seismological reports.        Mexico City's Tacubaya seismological station said the quake registered 6.0 on the Richter scale, and that it had no reports of damage. John Minsch, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said it registered 5.4.        Last September, a quake measuring 8.5 killed 8,000 people and caused extensive damage in the Mexico City area. A quake of 7.0 last Wednesday caused panic in some areas, but no damage was reported.        The Red Cross in Mexico City said it found no damage or injury.
