ANCHORAGE       Anchorage residents were shaken and reported hearing a loud boom as a small earthquake struck about 20 miles southeast of the city, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said.    Items fell off shelves throughout the city when the quake measuring 3.8 on the Richter scale struck at 10:24 p.m. yesterday Alaska Daylight Time, warning center seismologist George Carte said.    "There were some pretty good effects in Anchorage, but no serious damage and no injuries reported," he said.    Carte said the quake may have been an aftershock to one that measured 5.2 on the Richter scale when it struck on Turnagain Arm on May 18.
