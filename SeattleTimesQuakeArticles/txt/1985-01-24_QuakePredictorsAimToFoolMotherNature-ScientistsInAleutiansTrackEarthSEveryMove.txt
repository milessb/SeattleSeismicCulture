BOULDER, Colo. _ Researchers at the University of Colorado are painstakingly unraveling a series of elusive clues that could help them predict one of nature's most destructive events _ earthquakes.        Using space-age technology planted in one of the most inhospitable climates of the world, the scientists are listening for every ``audible'' creak and groan the Earth gives off as two segments of its surface grind into each other.        And though they're not certain, Professor Carl Kisslinger and his associates think they have learned enough to predict a major earthquake, sometime before October, beneath the desolate Aleutian Island chain that runs between Alaska and the Soviet Union.       The chain of islands stretching in an arc across the North Pacific offers formidable working conditions. The barren, windswept landscape is deluged with 200 inches of rain a year and often obscured by thick clouds, making travel difficult.       The 14 remote sensing sites that scientists have set up throughout the chain must be reached by boat or helicopter, then by slogging across thick, spongy growth or through tall grass.       In those far reaches, the university seismologists have detected an ominous period of ``seismic quiescence'' _ a reduction in the number of minor earthquakes that routinely occur _ that began in 1982. They suspect that quiescence is often the calm before the storm, a quiet period when forces inside the Earth slowly build.        A second precursor, an increase in the number of moderate earthquakes at one point along the 90-mile seismic zone, may indicate growing stress on an ``asperity,'' a strong point along a fault that causes major earthquakes when it suddenly gives way.        The last major quake along the Aleutian fault occurred in 1971 in the middle of the island chain near Adak Island. It measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, strong enough to be considered a major earthquake capable of widespread damage.        The precursors that led to the 1971 earthquake are alarmingly similar to those the scientists at the university's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences have been observing since 1982. And that has led to their prediction of a major quake before October, also to be sited near Adak Island.        That doesn't mean the 6,000 inhabitants _ mostly U.S. Navy personnel at a nearby base _ should flee the area. Because there are few people or buildings in the western Aleutians, the chance of any major damage is remote.        The Aleutians, picked as the site for the university's earthquake research in the early 1970s, are near a place where two huge, rigid segments _ or plates _ of the Earth's surface collide. Because of the constant pushing, crunching and adjusting, the Aleutians are one of the world's most active seismic belts.        The University of Colorado is one of a dozen American universities, including the University of Washington, with major centers for earthquake research. Kisslinger, who initiated earthquake research there, is vice president of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, which includes 78 member countries.Caption:  MAPED WALKER / SEATTLE TIMES -- MAP -- QUAKE SITE?
