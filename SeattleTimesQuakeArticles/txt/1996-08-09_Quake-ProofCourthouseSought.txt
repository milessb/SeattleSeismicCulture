Earlier this year, King County Executive Gary Locke was getting ready to fight it out in court with Seattle Seahawk owner Ken Behring over whether the Kingdome would be safe in an earthquake.     Now, Locke is preparing to ask the Metropolitan King County Council to spend $80 million to make sure their own place of business won't fall down in a seismic event.     Locke will propose the county build an addition to the south side of the courthouse, shoring it up against earthquake damage and expanding the office space by nearly 25 percent.     The technique is similar to that used at Pacific Medical Center, noted Locke's spokesman, Frank Abe.     An addition to the building was used to provide stability, should an earthquake occur.     The recommendation that the county secure the 12-story courthouse with a nine-story addition was made by RSP-EQE, a local consulting engineer, and was reviewed by Skilling Ward Magnuson Barkshire, a Seattle structural engineering firm.     Locke will recommend the council next year spend $3.5 million for complete architectural work.      However, the county does not have a way to pay for the addition, should the council concur.     Pearl McElheran, facilities manager, said the county likely would have to sell bond issues to pay for part of the addition.
