EVERETT Snohomish County is sending another volunteer to help victims of California earthquakes.    This time it's American Red Cross staff member Jan Mildenhall who is leaving tomorrow to help victims of the Yucca Valley earthquakes. Mildenhall will be assessing damage for the Red Cross. Her work will help determine the financial damages and needs arising from the disaster.     The Yucca Valley earthquakes were among the strongest in the last 40 years. The main quake opened a 43-mile fissure in the desert, buckled highways, caused one death and heavily damaged dozens of homes. There are still aftershocks. Some local volunteers returned to Snohomish County recently after helping residents following quakes in Northern California.
