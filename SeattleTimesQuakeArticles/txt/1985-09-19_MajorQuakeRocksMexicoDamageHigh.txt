MEXICO CITY _ A major earthquake in the Pacific Ocean off the Mexican resort of Acapulco today caused severe damage in three Mexican states, collapsed buildings in Mexico City and reportedly killed at least 20 people in the capital        Officials reported that churches had collapsed in Jalisco, Guerrero and Michocan states, and several buildings were knocked over in the capital.        Telephone and Telex circuits were out to Mexico City, and flights from the United States were canceled, one airline official said, ``because we didn't know what we would find when we got there.''        Mexican television, broadcast live and monitored in Guatemala, showed firemen and rescue workers sifting for bodies through the rubble of collapsed buildings in the Mexican capital.        Firemen across the city of 16 million could be seen fighting to put out blazes started by the quake, which the U.S. Geological Survey said occurred at 8:18 a.m. and registered 7.8 on the open-ended Richter scale.        At least 60 people were feared trapped under the remains of two apartment buildings housing dozens of families and several bodies had already been found.     Two areas to the north of downtown Mexico City _ Colonia Roma and Colonia Doctores _ were reported to have sustained heavy damage.        Radio reports reaching the state of Guadalajara, north of the epicenter, said the Hotel Roma and television towers in Mexico City were among the damaged structures.        The Geological Survey said the quake was the world's strongest since one in Chile of the same magnitude which killed at least 177 people March 3.        Today's quake was centered about 250 miles southwest of Mexico City. The epicenter appeared to have been somewhere between the Guerrero beach resorts of Acapulco and Zihuantanejo.        The quake was felt as far as Corpus Christi and Houston on the eastern coast of Texas. In Houston, the National Weather Service said several large buildings were reported to have swayed, with window shades banging against the windows. Water was reported sloshing out of swimming pools in Texas and New Mexico.        The weather service issued a tsunami watch for Mexico, El Salvador, Ecuador and California but called it off some four hours after the temblor. Tsunamis are popularly but incorrectly known as tidal waves.        More than 700 people were killed and more than 300 miles of southeastern Mexico were left a shambles by a quake measured at 6.5 on the Richter scale in September 1973, when at least 24 cities, towns and villages were damaged.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.        An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.Caption:  MAP(MAP OF PART OF MEXICO SHOWING EPICENTER OFF PACIFIC COAST)
