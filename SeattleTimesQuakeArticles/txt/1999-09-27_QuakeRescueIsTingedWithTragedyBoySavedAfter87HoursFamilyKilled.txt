DALI, Taiwan - Listed in good condition, a 6-year-old boy flashed a peace sign to reporters and played with a stuffed koala in his hospital bed yesterday,  just a day after rescuers dug him out of the rubble that trapped him for 87 hours.    But the boy's parents and two sisters - one 4 months old and the other 4 years old - were killed when Taiwan's devastating earthquake knocked out the bottom floors of their apartment building Tuesday in this central Taiwan town, rescuers said.    Although the boy, Chang Ching-hung, repeatedly asked where his parents where while rescuers were trying to free him, he stopped inquiring about them after he reached the hospital, his aunt, Chen Shu-mei, was quoted as saying by the China Times Express daily.    The intelligent and mature boy probably knew his parents were dead, Chen said.    When his aunt told him that a lot of people have come to see him,  the boy  was quoted as saying, "Thanks everyone for being so concerned about me. I'm doing fine."
