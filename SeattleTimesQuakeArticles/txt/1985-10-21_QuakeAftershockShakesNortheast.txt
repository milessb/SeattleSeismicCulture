NEW YORK (AP) _ A mild earthquake jolted people awake today from Connecicut to northern New Jersey, two days after a minor quake struck the same area.        Claus Jacob of the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory said the tremor, centered in Westchester County, was an aftershock to Saturday's quake and registered approximately 3.0 on the Richter scale of ground motion.        The tremor occurred at 6:37 a.m. EDT and lasted about six seconds.
