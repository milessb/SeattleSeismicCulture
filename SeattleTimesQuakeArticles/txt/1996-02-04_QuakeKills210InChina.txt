BEIJING - A powerful earthquake ravaged a mountain city in southwestern China, killing at least 210 people and injuring 3,700 others, authorities said Sunday.    The quake's magnitude was reported as between 6.4 and 7 by different sources - capable of severe to widespread damage.      The quake hit at 7:14 p.m. (3:14 a.m. PST) yesterday. It was centered near Lijiang, populated mostly by the Naxi minority, about 180 miles northwest of the Yunnan provincial capital of Kunming. Lijiang has  a population of about 1.5 million.    Early today 210 people were known dead, said Chen Jie of the provincial government office. The state-run Xinhua News Agency said 3,700 were seriously injured.    Three medical teams and about 2,000 soldiers and local militiamen were sent to help, Xinhua said.    The extent of the disaster wasn't immediately clear. Wang Ze, also of the provincial government, said rescuers searched for victims throughout the night. There were no reports of foreign tourists killed or injured, Wang said.     The Yunnan provincial government had sent officials to the disaster-hit area along with a team of 50 people from the provincial seismological bureau to monitor for aftershocks after local monitoring equipment was knocked out by the quake.    About one in 10 homes in Lijiang were destroyed, and many newer ones were damaged, Xinhua said. Water and electricity were knocked out.     Tens of thousands of people were spending the night in the open for fear of aftershocks.    The news agency said the quake cut communications to one town, Zhongdian, the capital of an autonomous region in Yunnan for ethnic Tibetans.    Lijiang County, near the northwest corner of Yunnan, is an isolated area of rugged mountains and steep river valleys.
