TEHRAN, Iran — A strong earthquake shook central and northern Iran yesterday, killing at least 23 people — some buried by landslides on a mountain road — and seriously damaging more than 80 villages, the Interior Ministry and state-run media said. More than 100 others were reported injured by the 6.2 magnitude earthquake, which struck at 5:08 p.m. and was centered about 45 miles north of Tehran, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Eight provinces in central and northern Iran were affected by the temblor, with the worst-damaged villages near Alamout, about 80 miles west of Tehran. The quake unleashed landslides and falling boulders that killed 16 people and injured 70 others, state-run television reported. In Tehran, the quake broke windows, causing panicked residents to rush outdoors. The depth of yesterday's quake was estimated at between 10 and 16 miles, which makes it fairly shallow but still deeper than the Bam quake, said geophysicist Waverly Person in Golden, Colo. In other news, a moderate earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale hit northeastern and eastern Japan and shook Tokyo today; there were no reports of injuries or damage. There was no concern about tsunamis, NHK television said.Caption:  chartThe Associated Press: Earthquake hits Iran (G61M5MP3)
