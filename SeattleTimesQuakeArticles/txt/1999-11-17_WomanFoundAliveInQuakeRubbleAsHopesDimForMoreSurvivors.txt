DUZCE, Turkey - Israeli rescue workers pulled a dehydrated, semiconscious 42-year-old woman from the rubble of a six-story building before dawn today, five days after a killer earthquake devastated northwestern Turkey.    Sefa Cebeci was found in Duzce, one of the worst-hit towns, and taken to Istanbul, where she was hospitalized in critical condition. The rescue came as officials were giving up the search for survivors, fearing freezing temperatures would have killed anybody trapped under the debris from the second major quake to hit the region in three months.    No one had been found alive in Cebeci's pulverized apartment block since five people were rescued Saturday morning.    "We knew we would find people under there. We didn't know if they would be alive or dead. It was just chance," said Hasan Aksu, a Turkish translator working with the Israeli team.    Cebeci was pulled out barely conscious early today after a 3 1/2-hour rescue operation, just after her husband's body was dragged from the rubble.    She was flown to Istanbul by helicopter and hospitalized with a smashed right arm and kidney failure due to dehydration. Doctors said she would likely lose her arm.    Friday's quake was less catastrophic than the August quake that killed 17,000 people. However, the latest quake claimed 600 lives, destroyed hundreds of buildings and left thousands of homeless shivering through the cold as aftershocks continued to rock the region. A magnitude-5 aftershock rattled Duzce early today but did not immediately appear to have caused more damage.    Turkey's government is recouping some of the prestige it lost after the previous quake, when rescue efforts were poorly organized.    Soldiers rushed to Duzce, Bolu and other hard-hit towns while a crisis center quickly dispatched teams to the area.
