BANTUL, Indonesia â€” U.S. Marines joined an international effort Tuesday to deliver aid and medical equipment to nearly 650,000 Indonesians left homeless by a devastating earthquake, as hopes faded of finding more survivors. Two U.S. Marine cargo planes carrying a mobile field hospital landed in Yogyakarta, closest to the quake area in central Java, after cracks in the airport runway were patched. A disaster assistance response team from the U.S. Agency for International Development is being readied and the amphibious assault ship USS Essex, which has extensive medical facilities, is en route to the area, White House deputy press secretary Dana Perino said. The United States also increased its aid contribution to $5 million. The United Nations said at least 21 other countries have joined the effort to help those left homeless by Saturday's magnitude 6.3 quake, which killed more than 5,800 people. An estimated 647,000 people were displaced by the quake, nearly a third of them homeless and the rest staying with relatives, said Bambang Priyohadi, a senior provincial government official. As medical aid began to arrive, the threat of a health crisis appeared to be easing. Jan Egeland, the U.N.'s top humanitarian official, said the aid effort was going well.
