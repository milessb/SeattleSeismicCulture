LOS ANGELES - Predictions of a 60 percent chance that a major earthquake would strike on the southern San Andreas fault in the next 30 years are too high, and a new probability to be announced next year will be lower, leading members of a scientific panel charged with assessing quake probabilities for Southern California said yesterday    The panel, meanwhile, is divided over the chances of a big quake - magnitude 7 or larger - occurring on any of the 300 other important faults in Southern California. The scientists have delayed a previously scheduled Dec. 2 announcement of Southern California earthquake probabilities at least until next March to try to reconcile the differences.    Keiiti Aki of the University of Southern California, a co-chairman of the panel and science director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, said the panel had tentatively concluded a large quake was 90 percent likely in Southern California in the next 30 years. But, he said yesterday, that estimate was "too high" and was the source of some disagreement among scientists.
