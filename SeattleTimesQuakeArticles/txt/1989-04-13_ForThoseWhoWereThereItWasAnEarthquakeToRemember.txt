Seattle's largest earthquake occurred 40 years ago today. It hit at 11:55 a.m., killed eight people in Western Washington and caused tens of millions of dollars in damage.         The quake, centered between Tacoma and Olympia, was calculated to have a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter scale.         The quake, centered between Tacoma and Olympia, was calculated to have a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter scale, which had not been devised in 1949.         The quake occurred more than 30 miles below the surface in a plate of former ocean bottom that is thrusting beneath the continent.         Although Seattle's most powerful quake, it was not the biggest recorded in the Pacific Northwest. A quake that struck the North Cascades Dec. 14, 1872, is estimated to have had a Richter magnitude of at least 7.4. There were even more powerful earthquakes beneath Vancouver Island in 1946 and the Queen Charlotte Islands in 1949.         Geologists agree that more earthquakes will occur in Western Washington, although predicting the time and location is still impossible.         In the past year or so, there has been increasing evidence that the Pacific Northwest could be subject to greater quakes than any recorded here. A Geological Survey researcher has found places along the outer coast that apparently dropped suddenly as much as six feet. The most recent such event occurred about 300 years ago.         In other parts of the world with similar geologic conditions, the plate jerking its way beneath the continent has caused great earthquakes registering 8 or more on the Richter scale.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.        An earthquake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A magnitude 7 quake is a major earthquake, capable of widespread damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake capable of tremendous damage.         State Rep. Dick Nelson of Seattle, who is urging the Legislature to provide more money for the University of Washington's seismic network, arranged a display in the Capitol today to commemorate the 1949 quake. The UW's network of 100 stations is threatened by a reduction in federal support.
