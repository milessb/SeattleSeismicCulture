Earthquakes in Satsop! My, oh my! Now aren't you glad we stopped WPPSS from building those two nuke plants there? A well-placed 5.1 under those babies would have set the entire Puget Sound region aglow. Of course, one possible benefit would have been Mayor Schell's millennium committee saving a bundle on lighting up our bridges. And everything else! Jef Jaisun Bothell
