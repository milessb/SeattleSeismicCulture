RENO, Nev. â€” Dozens of minor earthquakes shook Reno on Sunday as a series of temblors entered its third month and prompted some frazzled residents to leave their homes. More than 150 aftershocks have been recorded on the western edge of northern Nevada's largest city after a magnitude-4.7 quake hit Friday night, the strongest quake in a sequence that began Feb. 28. There were no reports of injuries or widespread damage. Scientists have urged residents to prepare for the worse, saying the recent activity is unusual because the quakes started out small and continue to build in strength. After being awakened as many as four times a night by quakes, retiree Sandra Petty decided to spend nights 10 miles away at the Sparks home of her daughter, Stefanie McCaffrey. "The quakes have sent her emotions and nerves into a tailspin," McCaffrey said Sunday. "She just needed to get away." The strongest aftershock Sunday measured 3 and was recorded shortly before 11 a.m. Three other quakes larger than magnitude 3 have struck areas scattered hundreds of miles apart across northern Nevada since Friday night's 4.7 quake in Reno. The quakes around Reno began a week after a magnitude 6 one in the northern Nevada town of Wells, near the Utah border. The Feb. 21 quake has been followed by hundreds of aftershocks. Nevada is the third most seismically active state in the nation behind Alaska and California, according to the Nevada Seismological Laboratory. (Washington ranked fifth, after Hawaii.) Reno's last major quake measured 6.1 on April 24, 1914.
