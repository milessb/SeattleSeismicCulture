WASHINGTON â€” Did Osama bin Laden's secret lair crumble in the earthquake that devastated northwestern Pakistan? "There's a lot of people who know that that's an obvious question" was the most Pentagon spokesman Lawrence Di Rita would say yesterday about U.S. thinking on bin Laden's fate. Bin Laden has avoided capture since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The United States is offering $25 million for information leading to his killing or capture. He has been rumored to be taking cover anywhere from urban areas of Pakistan to remote cave structures winding along the Afghan-Pakistani border to villages in western Pakistan's lawless tribal areas. Any of these possible hideouts could have been shaken by Saturday's 7.6-magnitude quake, forcing bin Laden to move. Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at the RAND Corp. in Washington, noted that some also theorize that bin Laden may be hiding in the disputed region of Kashmir, controlled by the Pakistani military, which was devastated by the temblor. The region is difficult to move in and out of, Hoffman said, and Islamic extremist groups friendly to bin Laden have camps and operations there. When asked if additional effort was going toward finding bin Laden, Di Rita said: "We're not trying any harder or less to find bin Laden than we've been doing since 9/11." Di Rita said the U.S. military is flying reconnaissance missions to help pinpoint areas for emergency supply deliveries.Caption:  photoOsama bin Laden is believed to have masterminded the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S.
