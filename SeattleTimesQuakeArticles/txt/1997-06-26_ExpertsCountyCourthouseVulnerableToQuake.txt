SEATTLE - King County has made available to the public a brochure on "How to Survive in Earthquake Country."  But that might not help if you're inside one of the county's own buildings, the County Courthouse, when the big one hits     County officials said Monday's earthquake left some small cracks in the walls of the courthouse, at Third Avenue and James Street in downtown Seattle.     A major quake could cause the 12-story building to collapse, according to experts.     Consulting engineers from the county Department of Construction and Facilities Management told Metropolitan King County Council members that without structural reinforcement, the courthouse would twist and split apart in a magnitude 8 or 9 quake. Monday's quake, centered off Bainbridge Island, registered 4.9.     According to the study, "Courthouse Seismic Stabilization Project," the county expects that the courthouse, if not seismically strengthened, would  collapse in a 500-year event.     In a more moderate  quake, it is likely that the building would sustain major structural damage, and that some sections might collapse.     "The potential for loss of life is considered high," the report said.     County officials have long called making the courthouse more quake-proof or replacing the building altogether.     Gov. Gary Locke, while he was still county executive last year, proposed  a study of renovations to make the courthouse safe in an earthquake.     The county's study said the courthouse is essentially the most dangerous place in the area to be during a major earthquake.
