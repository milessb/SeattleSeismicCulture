ISLAMABAD, Pakistan  - A powerful earthquake jolted Pakistan before dawn today, sending panic-stricken residents running into the streets. At least 95 people were killed and 125 injured, the official news agency said        The quake, centered hundreds of miles away in neighboring Afghanistan, measured 6.8 on the Richter scale. The minute-long tremor at 4 a.m. struck many of the victims while they were asleep in fragile sun-baked mud huts.             There were no immediate reports on the quake from Afghanistan. No communication links exist between Pakistan and Afghanistan.        The official Soviet news agency Tass said the quake rocked the central Asian republics of Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan, but reported no casualties. It said the quake caused landslides and destroyed communications, power transmission lines, roads and several residences in Tadjikistan.        Most of the damage in Pakistan was confined to the sparsely populated tribal area only miles from the Afghan border.        But about 2 million people live in the Afghan capital of Kabul, about 200 miles southwest of the epicenter.        Pakistan's state-run television reported more than 100 homes were destroyed in the dusty northwest Pakistan frontier region about 400 miles from the quake's epicenter.        The quake, which is considered severe, rattled windows in the capital of Islamabad for about a minute and sent frightened residents fleeing into the streets.        Among the worst affected were Afghan refugees living in camps throughout the frontier region.        ``We rushed emergency assistance to the remote areas around Chitral,'' about 200 miles from Islamabad, a government official said.
