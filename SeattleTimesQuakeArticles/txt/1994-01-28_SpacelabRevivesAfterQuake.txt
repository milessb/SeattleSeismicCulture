REDMOND - The Jan. 17 earthquake in Los Angeles that  damaged SpaceLab Medical's primary manufacturing facility will cost the company less than $2.5 million in uninsured pretax expenses. SpaceLab said the plant has resumed operations at 80 percent of capacity.     SpaceLab, a maker of clinical information systems and patient-monitoring products, said getting the plant fully on line will take up to 90 days.
