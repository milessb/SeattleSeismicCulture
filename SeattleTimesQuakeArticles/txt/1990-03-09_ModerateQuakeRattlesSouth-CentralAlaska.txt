PALMER, Alaska - A moderate earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale shook wide sections of south-central Alaska early today, but there were no immediate reports of any damage or injuries, officials said        The quake was centered about 60 miles northwest of Homer, said Alec Medbery of the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center.        ``It was felt all the way from Kodiak Island to Anchorage, Palmer and Seward,'' Medbery said. ``But it was too small for a tsunami,'' a sea wave generated by a quake.        The 1964 ``Good Friday'' Alaska earthquake that measured 8.5 on the Richter scale generated large waves that devastated several coastal communities, including Valdez, and killed 131 people as far south as Hawaii.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times strong than one of 6.5.        An earthquake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage,  5 considerable damage, and 6 severe damage.
