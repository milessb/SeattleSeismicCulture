WESTMORLAND, Calif. _ A second strong earthquake in 12 hours shook the Southern California desert early today, causing at least three injuries, knocking trailers off foundations and damaging a major irrigation canal        The wall of at least one building collapsed on cars, power was knocked out to many areas, fires were reported in a Mexican border town, and the border crossing was closed.        The California Division of Mines and Geology estimated that the quake shifted the land 4 to 6 inches along the Superstition Hills Fault.        The latest quake, at 5:16 a.m., was given a preliminary reading of 6.3 on the Richter scale, said Russ Needham of the National Earthquake Information Service at Golden, Colo. The epicenter was put at 14 miles west of Westmorland.        A 6-magnitude quake is capable of causing severe damage in populated areas.        ``The little damage we had from this one is directly attributable to the fact there's nothing nearby to be damaged,'' said Lucille Jones, a U.S. Geological Survey seismologist in Pasadena.        Last month, the 5.9-magnitude Whittier quake and aftershocks caused $358 million in damage in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Seven people were killed.        Today's quake apparently hit the border city of Calexico hardest, according to early reports. Authorities investigated reports of three gas leaks, said police dispatcher Daniel Saenz. One person was injured.        The U.S.-Mexico border crossing was closed at Calexico to guard against looting, Saenz said.        Calexico fire Capt. Carlos Escalante said the wall of a furniture store collapsed.        Escalante said he believed the quake had sparked a fires across the border in Mexicali.        Power to 65,000 households and businesses served by the Imperial Valley Water District went out after the quake, but it was back on for 95 percent of the customers within 20 minutes, said district spokesman Ron Hall.        Bulldozers worked to repair banks of the district's All-American Canal, which carries water from the Colorado River to the Imperial Valley, Hall said.        At least two other minor injuries were reported in the county area, including a pregnant woman who fell down her stairs during the quake, said Imperial Valley Assistant Sheriff Ted Whitmer.        Today's quake was felt 50 miles west of Phoenix, Ariz. It also jolted residents in Palm Springs, San Diego and downtown Los Angeles.        A strong earthquake that struck the area last night cracked windows and shook people as far away as Las Vegas, Nev.        It registered 6.0 on the Richter scale, officials said, and was centered 11 miles northwest of Westmorland, a city of about 1,500 people.Caption:  MAP PHOTOAP: MAP OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHOWING LOCATION OF EARTHQUAKEAP: TODAY'S EARTHQUAKE KNOCKED FOOD OFF THE SHELVES AT THE SAFEWAY STORE IN EL CENTRO, CALIF.
