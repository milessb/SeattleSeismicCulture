DUVALL - Aftershocks have continued to rattle the Duvall area since the magnitude 5.3 earthquake May 2, but scientists don't expect to have a clear picture of quake geology for another week.     A total of 368 aftershocks have been recorded within 3 miles of the quake epicenter since May 2, 10 of them strong enough to have been felt. The biggest was a magnitude 3.6 on May 4, and the most recent perceptible one was a magnitude 2.9 at 1:50 p.m. Wednesday.     In mapping the aftershocks, scientists found a pattern suggesting more than one fault plane has been involved, said Ruth Ludwin, a University of Washington geophysicist.     After accumulating recent data, scientists hope to double-check that result and by next week have a better idea which fault or faults produced the earthquake.     Details on the earthquake are available through the University of Washington geophysics department web site at http://www.geophys.washington.ed
