SIKESTON, Mo. - Seated around a table during Sunday school at the Powerhouse of God church, the seven children seemed in agreement: No, they weren't worried about an earthquake. And yes, they think adults have blown it out or proportion        ``I think it's a bunch of bull,'' said a boy named Eric, summing up for the group. ``I'll be playing like I always do.''        His aunt Hazel, however, planned to sleep in her truck Sunday and Monday night, he said. ``The old people get all shook up.''        Indeed they do, and all because of Iben Browning's projection of a 50-50 chance of an earthquake of 6.5 to 7.5 on the Richter scale 48 hours either side of today along the New Madrid Fault here, along the Hayward Fault in California, or in Tokyo.        Most of the attention generated by the prediction, and most of the reaction it, has been centered on the rich stretch of delta land known as Missouri's Bootheel, under which the New Madrid Fault runs.        The city of New Madrid, a town of about 3,200, has become the center of the media universe. A dozen or more television satellite trucks, from Atlanta to Kansas City, are parked downtown. Every 10 yards or so yesterday, someone was being interviewed; reporters were even interviewing reporters.        Residents with video cameras were recording it all. T-shirt and barbecue sales were brisk.        A balladeer sang an earthquake song for a network television crew. A St. Louis radio station had its truck parked on the lawn in front of the history museum in preparation for a live broadcast today.        It all had the atmosphere of a street carnival instead of impending disaster.        But for many of the people who live in the towns that make up the Bootheel, of which Sikeston is the largest with about 17,430 people, the fear is real. They believe that Browning might be correct.        Browning, a business consultant from New Mexico, has said tidal forces are unusually high now and could trigger earthquakes. Scientists from the National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council say Browning's method produces results no better than ``random guessing.''        But that is no comfort for residents like Anna Harper. ``I'm terrified of this,'' said Harper, a businesswoman and mother of three. ``I feel like it'ssome terminal illness. I don't want to believe it, but there is so much talk about it.''        Jo Ann Melton, who works at a golf course, is a believer too. ``I believe and have for a long time that we will have a major earthquake,'' she said. For evidence, she points to the growth of certain crops that otherwise are not common in the area and stories from other people that the ground just feels hot.        ``I don't know why I believe. I just do.''        Brenda, a bartender at the Sikeston Inn who would not give her last name, has a theory about that: ``You see something on TV and you believe it.''        Radio preachers delivered fiery sermons yesterday about the Bible's references to earthquakes. ``Earthquakes are a confirmation that our Lord's coming again,'' one said.        Many residents have left the area; one family sent its young children to Wisconsin until after the new year. And several people will be sleeping in their cars in hope of avoiding disaster.        But most people accepted the risk long ago. After all, many residents said, its not as though they didn't know they were living on a fault line.        The New Madrid Fault, in some ways, is the least of the region's problems. Seemingly more intractable are the number of substandard homes, the poverty rate, the teen-pregnancy rate and the illiteracy rate - all of which are well above national norms.        And the economy here has been depressed almost from the time that mechanization began to dominate agriculture.        The tabletop farmland is among the nation's more fertile, and there are many large, prosperous farms, although they are in the hands of few owners. ``We call it the so-good, no-good land,'' a man said.        With the area's grim economic and social profile, the last thing some civic boosters wanted to see was a national focus on its prodigious fault line.        Mary Doggett, Sikeston's economic development specialist, put out a suggested list of stories for reporters to do if the earthquake does not happen.        ``We really do think we have some attractive features,'' she said. ``It's not a bad place to live. All over the nation, this has become so totally ridiculous.        ``It just seems unfair that one individual in New Mexico can create this kind of situation.'
