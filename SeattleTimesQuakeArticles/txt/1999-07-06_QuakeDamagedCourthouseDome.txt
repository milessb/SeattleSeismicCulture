MONTESANO, Grays Harbor County - Part of the dome of the historic County Courthouse may have to be removed because of damage from the Friday earthquake that shook Western Washington.    The state Emergency Services Division determined that the building is structurally sound, but that outside sandstone walls and structures were cracked and need to be secured so no more pieces fall off.    The most visible damage from Friday's earthquake occurred in Aberdeen and Montesano, 10 miles west of the epicenter at Satsop.    The three-story courthouse, built in 1910, suffered extensive damage to its dome, which was shifted two inches. Falling debris - some pieces measuring up to a foot across - punched holes in a metal roof installed just two weeks ago.    Inside, cracks - some big enough to swallow a man's hand - ran across walls and ceilings. Murals were warped by the shifting.    Prosecutors, judges and others who work in the building will be moved into short-term quarters for now.
