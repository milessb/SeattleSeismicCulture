PASADENA, Calif. - A sharp earthquake beneath City Hall jarred Southern California early yesterday, toppling bottles from store shelves, knocking out power to thousands of homes and injuring at least 24         The 3:38 a.m. quake registered 5 on the Richter scale, said Hall Daily, a spokesman for the California Institute of Technology Seismology Laboratory. Several aftershocks were recorded, the largest measuring 2.6.         No serious damage was reported.         Twenty-four people were treated for minor injuries at four hospitals. Most suffered cuts and bruises from falls, nursing supervisors said.         The quake was felt at least 90 miles away, in San Diego. The earth shook across 15,000 square miles and seven counties for about 15 seconds.         An earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage in the local area, 6 severe damage and 7 heavy damage.         It was the strongest quake in the Los Angeles area since a 5.9 temblor on Oct. 1, 1987, and an aftershock two days later killed eight people, injured 200 and caused $358 million in damage.Caption:  PHOTO
