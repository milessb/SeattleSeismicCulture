TOKYO--Japan's strongest earthquake in five years shook broad swathes of western regions today, knocking people to the ground, shattering windows and burying at least two construction workers in landslides. The quake, a magnitude of 7.1 on the open-ended Richter scale, was the country's biggest since the deadly Kobe earthquake in 1995, the Meteorological Agency said. It was felt as far away as Tokyo, more than 350 miles away. Two people were buried when the earthquake triggered landslides at two construction sites in Shimane Prefecture on the coast of the Sea of Japan, said public broadcaster NHK. Rescue workers were digging to free them. The earthquake, which hit rural areas the hardest, was powerful enough to knock people off their feet and shatter windows. There were no confirmed reports of casualties and the extent of any damage was unclear. A local official in Shimane Prefecture said that there were reports that some houses collapsed. National television showed live footage of workers in a newsroom clutching desks as notebooks crashed to the floor. One hanging lamp was shown swinging wildly back and forth. "I felt a big jolt and then there was shaking for at least 10 seconds and I couldn't stand up," said one NHK television reporter. An electric power industry association official said nuclear power plants in the area were not affected as they had previously been shut for maintenance. No tidal-wave warnings were issued, but  aftershocks were felt in some areas. The focus of the quake, which struck at around 1:30 p.m. Tokyo time was some six miles below ground in western Tottori Prefecture, it said. Shinkansen bullet train services were halted between Toyohashi in Aichi Prefecture, central Japan, and Shin-Iwakuni in Yamaguchi Prefecture, western Japan.       Information from The Associated Press is included in this report.
