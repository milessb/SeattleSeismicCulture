SOME 70 million Americans live with a significant risk to their lives and property from earthquakes. That includes all residents of this area.         Yesterday's terrifying Los Angeles quake was a jarring reminder that the Puget Sound basin, like the coastal areas of California, is among the nation's high earthquake-risk zones.         Although still in its infancy, earthquake prediction is considered a reputable field of study. Scientists have identified several measurable physical, chemical and electrical changes that could indicate an imminent quake. In this field the United States and other countries can learn from China.         On Feb. 4, 1975, Liaoning Province in Manchuria was socked by a major earthquake. More than a million people lived near the quake's epicenter, and nearly 90 percent of the houses collapsed. Yet there were few casualties. Exactly one year later, a quake of similar magnitude struck Guatemala. More than 22,000 persons were killed and 75,000 injured.         Casualties from the Liaoning quake were low because Chinese scientists predicted it, and the government ordered the populace to leave their homes for tent cities and other open-air shelters. Less than six hours after the final evacuation order was given, the quake struck.         But if the science of quake detection is improved in this country, new areas of controversy will open up. The United States is not China. Could the  mass evacuation of an urban area be ordered and enforced on merely the likelihood, rather than the absolute certainty, of a catastrophe?         Such questions have been debated in dilatory fashion in connection with the danger of nuclear war. They may well be raised some day in relation to the  earthquake peril. At least one can hope that the advances in seismology, geophysics and geology will soon reach that point.         Better controversy than to wait, in ignorance, for Mother Nature to have her next spasm.
