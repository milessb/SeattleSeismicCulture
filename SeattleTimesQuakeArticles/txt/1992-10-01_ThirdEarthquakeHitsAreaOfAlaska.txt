PALMER, Alaska     A moderate earthquake struck in the Pacific Ocean about 60 miles southwest of Adak, Alaska, on the Aleutian Island chain, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said.    The quake, measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale, struck at 9:02 p.m. local time yesterday. It was the third earthquake in two days registered in the area. No damage or injuries were reported from any of the quakes.    "It's not unusual. It's one of the most active areas in the world," said warning-center geophysicist Guy Urban. He explained that the area is where the North American and Pacific plates of the Earth's crust are coming together.
