Washington is the nation's second-most-vulnerable state to costly damage from earthquakes, says a new federal study, and both Seattle and Tacoma are among 25 cities considered most at risk.     Seattle was ranked No. 7 and Tacoma was No. 22 among major cities that could expect severe quake damage.     The study by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) analyzes the value of buildings placed in vulnerable places, as well as the frequency and size of quakes.     The study, to be released today at the National Earthquake Risk Management Conference in Seattle, points out that quake damage is a national problem, not just one for California.     Large losses are expected for Seattle and Portland, as well as urban areas in California, the study says, because of the combination of quake risk and relatively high  building and real-estate prices.     The study estimated Seattle's annual damage at $128 million; Tacoma's  at $28.3 million, considering both major and minor events. Washington state's damage was placed at $228 million annually.     The annual estimates are averages obtained by analyzing historical earthquake patterns, then factoring in losses based on the severity of quakes. A major earthquake in Seattle would do far more than $128 million in damage, but such quakes have historically been less frequent than those that result in little or no damage.     FEMA officials used a method called Hazards U.S., in cooperation with the  National Institute of Building Sciences, to produce estimates of quake loss in particular areas based on mathematical formulas and data on local building inventories, geologic conditions and economics, among other things.
