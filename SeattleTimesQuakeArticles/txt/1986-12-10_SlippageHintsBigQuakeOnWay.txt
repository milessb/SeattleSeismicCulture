SAN FRANCISCO _ Scientists have found evidence that parts of the southern San Andreas Fault slipped several days after a moderate earthquake struck north of Palm Springs, Calif., in July _ a possible sign that the 5.6 temblor may be a precursor of a large quake on the long-dormant portion of the fault        No one is sure just what the unusual slippage means, scientists attending the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union here said yesterday. But they said the slippage was unique in that it appeared to have been set off by quakes some distance away.        ``Something is happening here that isn't happening elsewhere,'' said California Institute of Technology geologist Kerry Sieh, one of the foremost experts on the San Andreas Fault.
