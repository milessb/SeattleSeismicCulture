LONDON - Jumping up and down simultaneously, 1 million British schoolchildren succeeded in causing an earthquake yesterday in a scientific experiment. Thousands of schools around Britain were asked to send children out onto the playgrounds at 11 a.m. to jump up and down for a minute in hopes of creating a measurable quake to launch the government's Science Year. "We got some kind of result at every single seismometer around the country," said Nigel Pain, Science Year director. "We generated something like a hundredth of a serious earthquake - that's not an enormous amount of energy but it's significant." Early estimates suggested 75,000 tons of energy had been released during the minute of jumping. "Because it's dissipated across the whole country it didn't do very much damage. But drop that in one spot and it would have caused quite a big hole in the ground," Pain added. Scientists had predicted a million children with an average weight of 110 pounds jumping 20 times in a minute would trigger the equivalent of a magnitude-3 earthquake. Over the next two weeks the results from around the country will be analyzed to see if the event registered on the Richter scale. Before the big jump, some children were asked what would happen if a million kids jumped at once. One predicted the Earth would split in two; another said the planet would be thrown from its orbit. A third came up with a more down-to-earth prediction: "There will be lots of hospital  visits from people with sprained ankles."Caption:  photoJohn Stillwell / The Associated Press : Children at Kings Hill junior school in Kent, England, bounced gleefully into the air as they and thousands of other students helped generate an earthquake as part of a scientific experiment.
