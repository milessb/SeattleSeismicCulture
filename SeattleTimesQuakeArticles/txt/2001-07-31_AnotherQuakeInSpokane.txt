SPOKANE - A minor, shallow earthquake rattled people in the Spokane area last evening, shaking pictures off walls. The magnitude 3.2 quake occurred five miles below the Earth's surface and was centered four miles north-northwest of Spokane, the University of Washington Geophysics Program's Web site reported last night. No damage or injuries were reported from the 6:38 p.m. temblor. KXLY-TV got about 30 calls, largely from the north side of town, said staff member Beth Carey. "It sounded like an explosion, and the earth shook just momentarily," she said. Although the Spokane area has had no major quakes in its 120-year recorded history, a magnitude 3.4 quake on June 25 triggered a sequence that surprised scientists. The June 25 temblor caused minor damage - bricks falling from chimneys, cracked plaster, broken dishes - but no injuries. It was followed by 19 smaller quakes during a six-day span. But the ground was relatively quiet after that, with a 2.5 magnitude quake July 3 and a 1.4 magnitude one July 8.
