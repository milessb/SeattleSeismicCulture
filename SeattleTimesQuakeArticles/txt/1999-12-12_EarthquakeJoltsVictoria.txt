VICTORIA, B.C. - Residents of this Vancouver Island city were jolted awake early Friday by a mild earthquake.    "It woke me up. I was sort of half dreaming, then I realized it was an earthquake," said Diane Eccles, an employee of the Best Western Inner Harbour hotel.     "I was waiting for the aftershock, thinking maybe it would be bigger, but it never came."     She said the quake knocked some items off shelves. There were no reports of injuries or significant damage.    The quake was a magnitude 3.7 and was centered between Vancouver Island and the San Juan Islands in Washington, said Bill Steele, spokesman for the University of Washington seismology lab.    It was a deep quake, Steele said, occurring about 42.9 miles below the earth's surface.
