OAXACA, Mexico - Dozens of sick and injured patients shivered in tents yesterday after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake forced them to evacuate their hospital in Oaxaca city in Southern Mexico.    The death toll from Thursday's quake rose to 20, and officials said 3,850 buildings were damaged, as information trickled in from the remote mountains of Oaxaca state.    The quake forced authorities to evacuate 62 patients to the hospital plaza, where they spent the night under a 55-degree drizzle beneath two large plastic canopies.    Inspection teams, however, said the 34-year-old building sustained only minor damage and expected the patients would soon return to their rooms.
