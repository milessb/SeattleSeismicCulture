LOS ANGELES - The images were too familiar: rescue workers pulling victims from crumpled buildings. Collapsed freeways. A city afire.    This time, the earthquake struck on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, but for many people in Southern California, it stirred powerful memories of their own disaster.    "I feel a tremendous sense of compassion because we all know what they're going through," said Elana Coren of Northridge, one of dozens of people who gathered at a church last night to remember the Jan. 17, 1994, quake.      The magnitude-6.7 Northridge quake killed 61 people and caused $20 billion in damage.    At 4:31 a.m. today, the hour when last year's quake struck, 1,000 people attended a candlelight vigil at the site of the Northridge Meadows Apartments collapse, which claimed 16 lives near the quake's ground zero. There were tears and a choked-up rendition of "Amazing Grace."     "People of Kobe, we sympathize with you," read a cardboard sign on a fence surrounding the site.    Both quakes struck just before morning rush-hour traffic
