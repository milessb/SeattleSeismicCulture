KELOWNA, B.C. - About 12,000 homes in the Kelowna and Peachland areas near Okanagan Lake were without power for half an hour yesterday morning after a mild earthquake.    Measuring 3.8 on the Richter scale, the quake was centered about 19 miles east of Merritt and 34 miles south of Kamloops, in British Columbia. It struck at 4:30 a.m.    Officials said the outage was likely caused by a relay tripped by the tremors at the Nicola Lake substation, near the epicenter.
