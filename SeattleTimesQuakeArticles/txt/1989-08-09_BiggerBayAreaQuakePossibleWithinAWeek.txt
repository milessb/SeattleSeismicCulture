SAN JOSE, Calif. - The earthquake that rumbled through the San Francisco Bay Area yesterday left residents with more to worry about than broken glass and crooked pictures: The odds are greater than usual that the area could be rocked by a quake up to 10 times more powerful within a week        The warning by the state Office of Emergency Services came after an early-morning quake that registered 5.1 on the Richter scale and left one man dead and at least one family temporarily homeless. The quake caused some heavy damage and mostly minor injuries in Los Gatos and Saratoga.        Officials said the area may see a quake of 6.2 on the Richter scale within seven days. But they stressed the advisory was not a prediction.        ``It's not like a tornado warning, when it's been spotted and coming your way,'' said Terry Gitlin, coordinator for the Alameda County Office of Emergency Services. ``You can't exactly say that about an earthquake.''        The state's advisory is a warning about probability - in this case, a 1-in-20 chance that a large quake will hit, compared with the normal chance of 1 in 10,000. Chances will return to normal if the week passes and there has not been another quake.        A similar advisory was issued after an earthquake in the same area in June 1988. That next quake never happened.       City and county officials said they have emergency plans to coordinate services of police, firefighters and public-works departments, among others.        ``We're not looking at buildings falling,'' said Tom Mounts, San Jose's emergency-preparedness manager. Building codes have required that buildings meet seismic safety levels since 1957, he said. San Jose's office works on preparing for broken gas lines that could create fires and for glass breaking and flying objects that could cause injury, he said.         Yesterday's quake broke glass, sent objects flying and shook buildings violently enough to send one man to his death.         Matthew Bignall, 19, apparently was frightened by the first quake, at 1:13 a.m. - two aftershocks came later - and jumped out of his fifth-floor apartment window. He was the first person in Santa Clara County to die in an earthquake since 1906.        ``I'm sure he thought the building was coming down and that he'd have a better chance if he jumped,'' said 25-year-old Ron Burger, Bignall's stepbrother and roommate.Caption:  PHOTOUPI: CHAD EKLOF, ACTING NIGHT MANAGER OF A SAN FRANCISCO GROCERY STORE, SHOVELS GLASS FROM A WINDOW BROKEN BY YESTERDAY'S EARTHQUAKE.
