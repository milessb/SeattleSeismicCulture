FAIRBANKS (AP) _ A strong earthquake rumbled through a remote area of Alaska, but no damage or injuries were reported, according to the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.        Geophysicist John Minsch said that the quake measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale hit at 8:04 p.m. Alaska time and was centered 120 miles northwest of Fairbanks. It was felt in Fairbanks, but there were no reports of damage, he said.        ``They've had earthquakes in this area in the past,'' he said. ``The area out there where the earthquake was ... there's nothing there. There may be some small towns ... nothing that anybody's ever heard of.''        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
