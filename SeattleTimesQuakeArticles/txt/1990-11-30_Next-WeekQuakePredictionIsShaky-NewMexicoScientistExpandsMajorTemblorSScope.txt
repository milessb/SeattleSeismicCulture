SAN JOSE, Calif. - The self-styled earthquake prognosticator who sent Midwesterners - and Californians - scrambling to prepare for a major temblor on Sunday or Monday  has backed away from his claims         He now says the shaker could occur almost anywhere in the world.        And for a change, earthquake experts say he may be right, if for the wrong reasons.        Iben Browning, a New Mexico scientist and business consultant, holds the theory that the gravitational pull of the moon can actually tear the Earth's crust, resulting in devastating jolts.         He now says that in the next week such a major quake, caused by the highest tides in 18 years, is more likely to hit Tokyo, the Aleutian Islands or the Mideast than it is to strike the Midwest's New Madrid Fault or the East Bay's Hayward Fault, according to reports Wednesday.        Such a far-flung prediction stands a good chance of being correct, since quakes of a magnitude of 6.0 or greater occur somewhere in the world about 100 times a year, or an average of more than once every four days, according to the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Golden,  Colo.        So fire captains in Hayward, who had been planning to park trucks and engines outside the city's six firehouses just in case the roofs collapsed in a temblor, will keep their equipment inside as usual.        ``The City Council decided not to subscribe to the predictor's warning,'' said Gail Lundholm, the fire department's emergency education specialist.         ``They thought it might appear the city was lending credence to that prediction.''        Seismologists lend no credence to Browning's prediction. A special panel of experts concluded last month that ``there is absolutely no scientific basis'' for Browning's method of pinpointing the location and time of quakes, and they rebut his claim that he foresaw the Oct. 17, 1989, Loma Prieta quake.        Such sober analysis, however, did not deter residents throughout the U.S. from preparing for a massive jolt.        On Monday, Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft will tour the southeastern corner of his state, where schools will close and thousands of citizens are braced for a quake on the New Madrid Fault, which cuts through Missouri, Arkansas and Illinois and near St. Louis and Memphis.         On that same day, in what has been taken as a sure sign of an imminent quake, sportscaster Al Michaels will announce an event at Candlestick Park for the first time since he emceed the quake that interrupted his 1989 World Series telecast.        Earthquake experts do credit Browning with raising the public's awareness of earthquakes and the need to be prepared, especially in America's heartland.        ``There, it's new,'' said Jim Petroni, who runs earthquake response classes for local officials at the state's Specialized Training Institute in San Luis Obispo. ``They reacted to it like Californians would have 10 years ago.''        Up to 1,000 National Guard members and state and local emergency officials in Missouri will stage earthquake preparedness drills this weekend and more than a dozen school districts in that state will be closed Monday, said Edward Gray, who is heading the exercise.        The county coroner of Jonesboro, Ark., queried a Modesto firm about obtaining extra body bags in the event of a quake, homeowners have anxiously added earthquake insurance to their policies.         Thousands of people around the country are stocking up on emergency supplies.        ``There are no space blankets left in Los Angeles or Denver and tube tents are sold out all over the western states,'' said Brent Long, who sells earthquake kits at his Rational Behavior store in Mountain View.         Sales of his $36.95 kits have increased tenfold from 50 per month last summer to more than 500 per month now.        It's not just Midwesterners placing the orders, or reacting nervously. Long himself intends to keep his two children home from school Monday.        In Oakland, employees at Redwood Records will also take the day off, just in case.        ``We're not in panic mode, but we're definitely aware of the possibility,'' said Joanie Shoemaker, a partner in the recording firm.        And radio host Alex Bennett is using the occasion to promote his morning talk show as a ``death-defying'' event because he'll stay in KITS' dilapidated San Francisco studio on the day of the predicted quake.        In Missouri, despite the widespread commotion, the official line is that nothing unusual is expected.        ``Our policy here is that we don't think there's any strong likelihood on Dec. 3 than there is at any time until the end of the century,'' said Gray, the emergency coordinator. ``We don't advocate any pet theory.''        But Gray has his own methods, and said he is willing to put his money where his mouth is.        ``You want a prediction? I'll give you a prediction,'' he said. ``49ers 27, Giants 14.'Caption:  MAPKNIGHT-RIDDER NEWSPAPERS: MAP SHOWING QUAKE IN NEW MADRID FAULT ZONE (NOT IN ELECTRONIC VERSION)
