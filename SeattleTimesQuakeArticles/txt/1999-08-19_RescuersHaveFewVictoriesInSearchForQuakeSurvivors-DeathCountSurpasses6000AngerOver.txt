Rescue workers were recovering more bodies than survivors as they struggled in the wreckage of buildings flattened by Turkey's worst earthquake in 60 years.    But there were moments of elation.    Two came around midnight only 40 minutes apart, when rescue workers in the city of Golcuk helped  a man and a woman emerge alive from the ruins.        The magnitude of human tragedy was hard to gauge. The confirmed death toll grew by the hour as layer upon layer of flattened homes yielded new corpses, which overflowed hospital morgues and were laid in mosques, ice skating rinks and refrigerated meat trucks.    The Anatolia news agency said that in the hard-hit Izmit and Golcuk areas, 3,000 people were killed, an increase of 1,000 from the earlier official count.  The increases raise the official death toll to about 6,300.    So far, only two foreigners, both Germans, are known to have been killed. Both were in areas outside Istanbul, closer to the epicenter, where most of the destruction occurred.    Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Turks camped out in yards, parks and even on highway medians for yet another night in fear of going home - or because they had no home to go back to.    "We don't trust our own homes," said 21-year-old Dilek Turkmen as she watched rescue workers sifting through the rubble of a collapsed apartment building on the outskirts of Istanbul.    No point in Turkey seemed to symbolize the death and destruction wrought by the tremor more dramatically than Golcuk. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, may still be trapped under masonry.    It is a city physically and emotionally devastated.    Men and women weep at street corners, helpless at the prospect of mountains of rubble that entomb their loved ones.    Still, there was hope of finding some people alive.    In a dramatic scene aired on Turkish television, rescuers pulled 6-year-old Akin Sirnen, stunned and dust-caked, from the ruins of a house in Golcuk yesterday afternoon.     Workers later reached 38-year-old Aris Bayram, who was able to pull his legs out from a hole where rescuers had removed rubble. He had been trapped for 45 hours.     "Bravo, bravo," the crowd shouted. Many applauded.     His wife and children remained trapped.     As volunteer workers carried Bayram out on a stretcher, he wept and said, "My children have gone, my children have gone."      Across the street a short time later, workers pulled out Nimet Ozmen, a 33-year-old woman whose son Sezer, 7, was also rescued. Her husband Fikret, a baker, lay crushed to death beside her during the two days she was trapped. Israelis, Russians and Turks had worked together to free her.    Fresh rescue teams arrived from abroad overnight to continue searching for the missing. Many wore scarves over their faces because of the decaying bodies.    An Austrian team moved from building to building in Izmit, searching for survivors with sniffer dogs. They found no one and said they feared that most of those trapped in the wreckage may have  died of thirst.    Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit found himself increasingly under fire for his handling of the catastrophe.    Dwindling food supplies on top of crippled power and water lines in some areas added to the mood of desperation. Crowds mobbed a convoy of bread trucks that entered Izmit, where a huge refinery fire started after the quake continued to burn today.  The worst fear was that the blaze could engulf the entire field of 30 giant storage tanks, touching off an environmental disaster.    "When are they going to come and help us? When we are all dead?" cried Zeyfettin Kus in front of a collapsed apartment in Izmit where three neighbors were buried. He could no longer hear cries for help.    The Radikal newspaper blasted officials in a large headline: "The rescue is a pure fiasco."     "Helplessness" the national Sabah newspaper blared on its front page. "The people are helpless, the state is helpless, we can't even find a place to put our dead."
