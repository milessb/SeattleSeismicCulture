If "The Big One" ever hits the Puget Sound basin, no one can claim we weren't warned.     Saturday's magnitude 5.0 earthquake, the biggest here in 30 years, was eerily similar in its geology to the much bigger 7.2 quake that heavily damaged Kobe, Japan, two weeks ago, said Bill Steele, seismology-lab coordinator at the University of Washington.     The 7:11 p.m. tremor  buttressed recent warnings from geologists that "it can happen here." Their concern has been prompted by major quakes in California in 1989 and 1994 and a series of recent scientific discoveries about historical earthquakes in this state.     "I think everyone is spooked," Steele said of local seismologists.     He explained that Saturday's quake was a mild version of the type of seismic disaster that officials particularly fear.     It was relatively shallow - the closer a quake is to the Earth's surface, the more its energy is felt - and it occurred in the state's most heavily populated area. Moreover, it was possibly triggered by the Seattle Fault that severely shook this area with a shallow 7- to 7.5-magnitude quake 1,100 years ago.     Saturday's earthquake was different than the deeper earthquakes that hit Puget Sound in 1965 and 1949. Those occurred at the boundary between the North American Plate and the Juan de Fuca Plate far beneath Puget Sound.     The Earth's surface, including its sea floor, is made of crustal plates that float and move on its hot, molten interior. Their slow collisions generate earthquakes and volcanoes. The Juan de Fuca Plate sea floor dives under North America off Washington's coast, angling down under Puget Sound until it merges near the Cascade Mountains with the planet's mantle, the hot molten layer of rock between the Earth's crust and its core.     Saturday's earthquake, in contrast to those in '65 and '49, was not 30 miles deep at the plate boundary but about 11 miles deep at a fault in the middle of the continent's crust. Its epicenter has been located on the eastern tip of Maury Island, across Puget Sound from Federal Way.     The epicenter does not necessarily pinpoint where the worst damage will be. Auburn was harder hit, explained Steele, because that city sits in a river valley with silty soils more prone to move and liquefy. Federal Way, by comparison, sits on a firmer ridge of compacted glacial gravel and sand. Soils make a big difference      An example of how soils make a difference was seen in 1989's Loma Prieta earthquake near San Francisco. Soils under a Nimitz Freeway bridge that collapsed in Oakland moved 10 times faster than firmer upland soils closer to the quake's source, Steele said.     Still unclear is what underground feature triggered Saturday's earthquake. U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist Brian Atwater has broached the idea that the Seattle Fault, first identified in 1992 as the source of the devastating earthquake 1,100 years ago, could have been a cause.     Atwater suggested the Seattle Fault may not be vertical but instead slope southward and downward from Central Seattle, possibly extending as far as Maury Island and Federal Way. Another wedge-shaped block of land would rest atop it, and the joint between these two may have slipped Saturday, causing the earthquake.     Scientists at the UW's geophysics laboratories will discuss that hypothesis this week. No threats, no guarantees      Steele said Saturday's earthquake is neither a predictor of more earthquakes in the near future nor a guarantee of fewer earthquakes because pressure was relieved. Puget Sound's geology is simply too complicated and too unknown to draw either conclusion.     "A large earthquake in coming decades is a possibility, but we just don't know," he said. "Overall, we need more research in this area. This is where the population center is, and we've got these huge unknowns."      The earthquake is not believed to be a warning of worse shocks in the near future. The Kobe earthquake, for example, was not preceded by smaller tremors such as the one experienced Saturday, local seismologists said.     Because the earthquake intensity scale is logarithmic, there was a big difference between Saturday's magnitude 5.0 earthquake and Kobe's 7.2. The Japanese quake had more than 100 times the ground motion and more than 1,000 times the energy.     That does not mean Saturday's tremor was insignificant. In simple energy, it approached that of the 1946 Bikini Atoll atomic-bomb test, according to a table in Bruce Bolt's text "Earthquakes."           And there were intriguing similarities between the Seattle jolt and that of our Japanese sister city.     Both cities are about the same distance from offshore trenches that mark the collision boundary between two plates. Both are on inland waters and have large areas of filled tidelands. Both quakes were relatively shallow - about 11 miles deep - and both were thus rare because they were relatively big and yet not on plate boundaries.      The last major shallow quake in Kobe was in 600 A.D., and the last one in Seattle big enough to leave evidence was about 900 A.D.     That evidence includes groves of forest that slid into Lake Washington, the upheaval of Alki Point and Bainbridge Island, the dropping of West Point, and a tsunami that struck the southern tip of Whidbey Island.     There were differences as well, however. Not only was the Kobe earthquake far more powerful than Saturday's quake, but it was a strike-slip or side-slip quake in which land on either side of a fault, or fracture in the crust, slipped sideways. Saturday's earthquake appears to have been a thrust fault quake in which two pieces of crust, one atop the other, shifted. "Big-time earthquake country"      While no serious damage appears to have been done, the tremor is another reminder that Western Washington is, in the words of USGS coordinator Craig Weaver, "big-time earthquake country." It lies on the Pacific Rim, where 80 percent of all the earthquake energy in the world is released each year because of the collision between Pacific Ocean plates and surrounding continents.     While Washington does not have a spectacular fracture such as California's San Andreas Fault, scientists in the last few years have identified several potential threats:      --  The most common big earthquakes here in the past have occurred about 30 miles under the Puget Sound basin, where the ocean floor of the Juan de Fuca Plate is being subducted under, or overridden by, the North American continent. Examples are a magnitude 6.2 earthquake under Puget Sound in 1939, the 7.1 earthquake here that killed eight in 1949, and the 6.5 earthquake that injured 31 in 1965.     --  Also common, but usually less intense, are shallower earthquakes inside the crust along fault lines: earthquakes similar to Saturday's tremor. Examples include a magnitude 5.9 earthquake near North Bend in 1945 and a magnitude 5.8 earthquake near Mount St. Helens in 1981. The latter was in the volcano's seismic zone but not caused by volcanic activity.     Occasionally such earthquakes are much more severe, and because they are closer to the surface their damage can be massive. An example is a magnitude 7.3 quake in 1872 in the North Cascades, powerful enough to send people running from buildings in Olympia and throw people to the ground at the future site of Wenatchee. The fault where it originated has not yet been identified. We've sure got our faults      The Seattle Fault believed to have caused a similar-size quake in 900 A.D. was discovered in 1992, and a Whidbey Island Fault believed capable of an equally big quake was identified as a hazard just last year.     Evidence in Lake Washington sediments of sudden landslides suggest there were other huge earthquakes here about 1,650 years ago, 2,300 years ago and 3,000 years ago. Such earthquakes today could be disastrous because they would be under area cities at a shallow depth.     --  The biggest potential earthquakes in terms of released energy occur off Washington's coast in the shallow subduction zone where the Juan de Fuca Plate begins to dive under the continental plate. The last such earthquake occurred about 300 years ago, and there have been at least six over the past 7,000 years.     Such earthquakes could have maximum magnitudes estimated from 8 to 9.5. At its worst, such an earthquake could muster energies a thousand times greater than the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, ravaging Washington's coastal communities and causing significant damage as far away as cities on Puget Sound.     --  Geologists estimated last October that the Cascade Mountains have averaged two volcanic eruptions per century over the last 4,000 years. Getting new study is Mount Rainier, which last erupted 150 years ago. About 60 mudslides have rumbled off the mountain over the last 10,000 years, some reaching as far as Auburn and Tacoma.     Earthquake damage is hard to predict. It depends on the intensity of the quake, its location, how shallow it is, the kind of soil a structure sits on, and the type of construction used.     University of Washington engineers said last week that Seattle would be unlikely to suffer damage as heavy as Kobe if a similar-sized earthquake struck here, because of differences in American and Japanese construction.     However, they warned, Seattle is vulnerable because of its dependence on bridges across numerous bottlenecks and its large areas of fill on old tideflats. That fill could liquefy and cause structures to failCaption:  ILLUSTRATION: MAP: PHOTO1) KNIGHT-RIDDER NEWSPAPERS: MEASURING THE EARTHQUAKE (CHART NOT AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY)2) CHRISTINE E.
