BELLEVUE Bellevue and Redmond Fire departments will wrap up Earthquake Awareness Month tomorrow  by putting on a display at Crossroads Mall on how families can prepare for an earthquake.   The fire departments said if the Eastside is hit by a powerful earthquake, people should be prepared to live for at least 72 hours on their own. The workshop tomorrow at Crossroads will start at 10 a.m. and will feature speakers who will review previous workshops and tell people what they need to do.
