MEXICO CITY _ Rescue workers carefully dug a series of tunnels today to move closer to a 9-year-old boy who has been buried alive for more than two weeks under 20 tons of rubble from a devastating earthquake         ``Someone's alive, someone is definitely alive down there,'' a rescue worker said today after probing deep into the rubble of an apartment building with sonar equipment. ``We heard him knocking back.''        The workers called for nearly an hour of silence at the site this morning so sound equipment could pick up signals from inside.        The tenacious survivor is believed to be Luis Ramon Navarate Maldonado, known by his nickname, ``Monchito.''        ``We have dug three tunnels in an attempt to reach him, but there is a great danger of cave-ins, so we're digging a fourth,'' said rescue worker Rene Rivera. ``The tunnels are about a meter and a half wide (5 feet), but there are tons of concrete on top of us when we're inside, so we're very careful.''      The boy was trapped Sept. 19, when an adjoining, eight-story textile factory fell on top of his three-story apartment house, pinning him and his grandfather. Relatives have insisted that the grandfather also is alive, but rescuers said they were picking up signs of life from only one person.        Relatives said that the boy and his grandfather, Luis Maldonado, 57, were the only ones in the family apartment when the first quake toppled hundreds of buildings, killing thousands of people.       The scene is about two blocks from the Zocalo, Mexico City's central square, which is dominated by the presidential palace and the national cathedral.         No other survivors from Mexico's quakes have been found since last Friday, when two newborn infants and a woman were discovered alive. The woman later died of her injuries.        Since the boy's distant signals were heard yesterday, progress reaching the boy has been very slow. Rescuers say they must take a circuitous route to reach the child because of the way a wall had fallen around him.            The child signaled to rescue workers yesterday that he was pinned down on his back but could wiggle his arms and legs.        The boy's tapping was faint because ``it is difficult for him to raise his hand,'' said Dr. Enrique Camacho Romero, a veterinarian in charge of one rescue team. Workers and doctors who visited the site said it appeared the child was too weak to talk.        A relief worker, Sergio Andreas Fernandez, said parallel tunnels had been dug and the boy was thought to be between them. A Red Cross worker said earlier yesterday that the operation was complicated because the floor had caved in around the boy.        Earlier this morning, rescuers were arguing over whether to continue burrowing tunnels or whether to try to use heavy equipment to move the tons of concrete that fell over the boy.        Rescue crews raced to slash through mesh wire in the concrete with an acetylene torch as dogs pawed and sniffed the rubble. Ambulances stood at the ready to whisk him to a waiting helicopter and a military hospital.        Two Red Cross workers said they had found damp clothing in the tunnel near the boy's apparent location. They said firemen had doused a fire in the building after the quake, and surmised that the boy and his grandfather squeezed water out of the clothing.Caption:  PHOTOAP: SONIA MARIBEL MALDONADO WAITS BEHIND A POLICE LINE FOR NEWS OF HER SON, LUIS, TRAPPED IN THE RUBBLE OF A MEXICO CITY APARTMENT BUILDING.
