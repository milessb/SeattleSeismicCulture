SAN FRANCISCO - The breeze wafting from San Francisco Bay into the posh Marina District carries with it the dust and rumble of rebuilding.         Dozens of construction crews are patching together homes and apartment buildings that slumped and crumbled during the earthquake that shocked the Bay Area last Oct. 17. Joggers now dodge large trash bins; their Walkmans muffle the sound of heavy equipment.         Amid the meticulously kept Victorian facades sit vacant lots littered with scorched debris. One building still shows a spray-painted ``searched'' sign.         A year after the earthquake, the area's strongest since 1906, people here are not only still digging out, but also preparing like never before for what scientists say will actually be The Big One.         The U.S. Geological Survey says there's a 67 percent chance that in the next 30 years the area will be hit by a temblor similar to or stronger than last year's Loma Prieta earthquake, which registered a 7.1 on the Richter scale. The next one could easily originate closer to the urban area and cause much more damage, they say.         Last October's quake was centered 50 miles south of the urban core in the sparsely populated Loma Prieta area, and was unusually short in duration. Since then, more than 7,000 aftershocks registering between 1 and 5.4 on the Richter scale have occurred here.         So after Jeff Kletzky's 18-unit apartment building on a corner in the Marina District was demolished, he laid a geologist's map over the city map to see where firm ground was. He now lives on the bedrock of Pacific Heights.         Geologists say ground motion in the bay mud of the Marina District was  three to four times stronger than in areas of bedrock. Amplified by the soft soil, the shaking toppled houses and  deformed streets.        Kletzky said his apartment looked like the inside of a shoe box that someone had vigorously shaken.         ``When I moved and unpacked, one box contained underwear, unpaid bills, 1979 canceled checks and notes from college,'' said Kletzky, 29. He competed with thousands of renters amid a landlord's market.         Three of the city's interstates and several ramps are still partly closed. A stretch of Interstate 280, which carried 87,000 vehicles a day before Oct. 17, will not reopen until next spring.          The Embarcadero Freeway, a waterfront arterial, is set to be torn down. San Francisco's Board of Supervisors, which functions like Seattle's city council, two weeks ago voted 6-5 to tear down the double-deck freeway and replace it with a sunken expressway.          Without the freeway, traffic between the Marina District and the Bay Bridge has wended its way through a tangle of city streets.         The state recently estimated it would cost $55 million to repair the Embarcadero Freeway. Motorists have clamored for any decision that will ease the snarls.         Like the Cypress viaduct in west Oakland, the Embarcadero route was built in the 1950s and never sufficiently upgraded to meet current earthquake-resistant standards.         Oakland is also still reeling from the quake. More than 135 commercial buildings, mostly downtown, have been declared unsafe. The Oakland City Hall was badly damaged, as was San Francisco's.         Seven low-rent downtown hotels were closed and only one reopened, adding about 2,000 to the city's homeless population, which now numbers about 5,000.         Many of the street people, squatters essentially, have broken past boarded-up facades to sleep in rooms littered with garbage.          ``What's the alternative?'' said Dan Bright, a tattered man who said he sleeps in closed hotels. ``It's not safe and it stinks, but the shelters are full and nobody seems in a hurry to do nothing about it.''        Zenobia Embry-Nimmer, director of the Emergency Services Network of Alameda County, said she and another volunteer rounded up tenants living in damaged low-income hotels and shelters while all attention was being paid to the collapsed Cypress structure, the double-deck roadway where 42 people died.         The homeless ``are truly the forgotten people of the earthquake,'' said Embry-Nimmer. ``It's like nobody thinks anything happened to them. People need to wake up and realize they were part of this, too.''          The quake did not do the expected damage to the coffers of insurance companies.          A survey of property and casualty insurers conducted by the California Department of Insurance and obtained by The San Francisco Chronicle found insured losses from the catastrophe totaled $590 million - almost 40 percent less than previous estimates.          The insured losses are just a fraction of the $5.9 billion in total damage believed to have been caused by the temblor, because nearly 90 percent of the losses were either uninsured or below the deductible.         A group of political and corporate leaders call the quake ``a dress rehearsal'' and are trying to create a regional disaster-response plan. Spearheaded by local mayors, the blueprint ranges from accumulating food and supplies to improving communication concerning pockets of destruction.        The California Department of Transportation has accelerated its program to retrofit hundreds of bridges, and says it must spend $500 million on seismic research and repairs over the next five years. Pushed by political pressure to open bridges sooner, Caltrans placed braces on portions of freeways only to find analysts calling them inadequate.         The Washington Department of Transportation had hoped that, by now, California would have come up with a solution that this state could incorporate in its retrofitting program.         While the average Bay Area resident shrugs at the prospect of a more damaging temblor, survival kits have been selling briskly and radio talk shows and newspaper columns are still brimming with quake-related stories.          James Cope, a retired security guard, sat in a cafe sipping coffee on a recent morning as commuters rushed to work. He seemed insulted by talk of what more the locals are preparing for.         ``Maybe I should move to Seattle,'' he said, ``and get caught in one of those hellish rainstorms.''    -----------------------------------------------------------    After the fall    -----------------------------------------------------------    THE DAMAGES    The damage estimates below have been reported by the 10 counties affected and do not necessarily represent verified losses.
