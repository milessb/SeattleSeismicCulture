LOS ANGELES - State Farm Insurance quietly paid more than 100 policyholders a total of $100 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of covertly trimming coverage years before the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the Los Angeles Times reported today.    State Farm admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement, which was reached in September and is the largest known single payout by an insurer involved in post-earthquake claims, the newspaper said.    According to an internal company memo in September 1984, executives considered informing policyholders about restructuring plans but decided against it because it would "appear inconsistent with our marketing philosophy."     The lawsuit said two insurance plans were ultimately replaced by a less-expensive policy that State Farm described to policyholders as "new" or "different" without disclosing that it amounted to less coverage, according to the lawsuit filed by 117 homeowners.
