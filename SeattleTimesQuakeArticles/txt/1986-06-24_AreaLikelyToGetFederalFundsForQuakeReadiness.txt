The Puget Sound area seems almost certain to qualify for $5 million to $6 million in federal funds to help prepare for earthquakes.         This would be the fourth such high-risk area selected for a federal program led by the U.S. Geological Survey, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Science Foundation and the National Bureau of Standards.         The other three areas are the Bay Area, along the San Andreas Fault; the Los Angeles area, along the San Andreas and other faults; and the Wasatch Range in Utah.         Walter Hays of the Geological Survey, who met here yesterday with FEMA officials, said the program, which would assess the region's level of preparedness, should get under way in October with the beginning of the next federal fiscal year. It would take about three years to complete.         About the only thing that could upset the project, Hays said, would be a serious earthquake in some other region that would change priorities and divert funds.         The results would be used to guide engineers and designers in building safer buildings and teach homeowners how to reduce damage by such measures as retrofitting houses to keep them from sliding off foundations during an earthquake.         The devastating Mexico City quake of last September probably helped move the Puget Sound area to a higher priority.         That was a subduction earthquake, caused by a rigid segment of Pacific Ocean bottom thrusting beneath the continent. There is growing scientific opinion that there are similar geological conditions here, making the Puget Sound area vulnerable to huge subduction quakes, more serious than any known to have occurred in the Pacific Northwest.         The region around Anchorage, also believed vulnerable to subduction earthquakes, is close behind Seattle on the priority list drawn up by the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.         The Puget Sound preparedness program will end with an effort to put information into use _ which will be the hardest part, Hays said.         ``It will involve transforming a mountain of data into actual laws, ordinances, building codes, land-use plans and measures to mitigate earthquake damage,'' he said. ``It will boil down to the questions, `What will it cost?' and, `Where will we get the money?'         ``That will be the real test of commitment,'' he said. ``The locals won't be able to leave it to the federal government, and Washington, D.C., can't leave it to the locals.'Caption:  PHOTOWALTER HAYS: DETAILS PLAN FOR STUDY
