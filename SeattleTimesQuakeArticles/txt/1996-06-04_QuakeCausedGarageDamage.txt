BELLEVUE - Last month's 5.4-magnitude earthquake apparently triggered the collapse of a piece of the Bellevue Square parking garage Friday afternoon, said George Wrede, an architect and vice president of the mall owner, Kemper Development Co     No one was injured but a car was slightly damaged when a portion of the outside wall pulled away from the fourth floor of the garage. About 80 parking spots were lost in the collapse of the northwest edge of the garage.
