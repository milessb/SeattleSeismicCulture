CORVALLIS, Ore. - Half the buildings on the Oregon State University campus would suffer major damage if a large earthquake struck off the Oregon Coast, according to a recent study.    Most of the 130 buildings were not designed to withstand earthquakes, said Thomas Miller, a civil engineering professor who supervised the study.    The study was conducted on the premise that an earthquake of magnitude 8 or greater could strike 50 miles off the Oregon coast.    According to the study of the university's 73 residential and academic buildings, 48 percent - seven dormitories and 28 buildings housing classrooms - would sustain major structural damage.    Some of the buildings would collapse entirely, Miller said.    "In some buildings, we're talking about a lot of people dying, and in other buildings we're not talking about any people dying," Miller said.
