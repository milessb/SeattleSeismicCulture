PALMER, Alaska _ A minor earthquake yesterday did no damage in Alaska, but it was strong enough to grab scientists' attention in this city in the Matanuska Valley.        ``It was felt strongly here in Palmer,'' said Paul Whitmore, a geophysicist here at the Tsunami Warning Center, which tracks earthquakes to detect those which could cause tidal waves.        The quake, which registered 3.7 on the Richter scale, was centered 20 miles northwest of Palmer.
