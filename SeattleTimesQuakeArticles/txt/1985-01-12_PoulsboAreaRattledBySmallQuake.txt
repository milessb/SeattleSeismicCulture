An earthquake that registered between 3 and 3.3 on the Richter scale struck the Poulsbo area of Bainbridge Island early yesterday.         Though no damage was reported, the temblor spurred a number of calls to the University of Washington seismology center. The quake _ its epicenter about 50 miles south-southwest of Port Townsend _ hit at 5:07 a.m.         Earthquakes of that intensity occur in the Puget Sound area about 15 to 20 times a year but often aren't noticed, according to Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the seismology center.        This one, she said, was felt because it took place closer to the surface.        The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans, while a quake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage.
