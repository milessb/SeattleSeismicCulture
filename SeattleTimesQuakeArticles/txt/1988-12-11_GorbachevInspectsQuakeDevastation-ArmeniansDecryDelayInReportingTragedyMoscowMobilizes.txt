Times staff reporter Richard Seven and staff photographer Alan Berner were in the Soviet Union on assignment when the Armenian quake occurred.         MOSCOW - The small Armenian church was lit by flickering candles of hope, but Bishop Tiran Gureghian wanted to speak about the Soviet government, and not God.         ``Everyone is asking, `Where is God? Why did this happen,' '' said Gureghian, who was flanked here yesterday by dozens of parishioners of St. Resurrection Church. ``This accident is not political, like Chernobyl. There were people dying, trapped and bleeding. They needed immediate help.         ``Why didn't they report this tragedy sooner?'' he asked, referring to Soviet officials. ``With every hour they delayed, we lost lives.''         It took officials an estimated eight hours to report Wednesday's earthquake, which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale and has killed an estimated 45,000 people and left another 500,000 homeless in the Republic of Armenia.         As the bishop spoke, parishioners huddled in rows and rows of candles lit for the dead and missing. One man stared as if in a trance at the flames for more than five minutes.         Outside the church, which sits in the middle of a cemetery, a group of men passed around rumors about the disaster.         Gureghian said Armenians across Moscow and in the United States have donated money and medicine. Many of his parishioners have signed up to take in some of the thousands of orphans expected to be brought into the Moscow area eventually.         Officials of the Central Committee of the Communist Party were unavailable to respond to the bishop's criticism, but party officials said yesterday the Armenian Republic's government was too slow to find accommodations and food for the survivors of the quake.         Church officials in Moscow, where an estimated 180,000 Armenians live, are in the process of asking the government for the use of youth camps and sanitariums as homes and schools for the Armenian orphans. Meanwhile, several hundred volunteers of all ethnic groups were manning emergency centers set up at the Armenian Embassy and the headquarters of the Moscow City Komsomol Committee.         Maria Samoshkina stood off to the side of a basement room in the embassy and watched workers sort through clothes, blankets, food and toys to be bundled and sent to the disaster area. She was a radio operator in World War II and said she understands the need for help.         ``My property was destroyed in the war,'' she said, crying softly into a handkerchief. ``God reminds us that beyond the silly conflicts between races of people are true tragedies like this. God treats all of us the same, and we should do it, too.''         Nearby stood Vanic Israelian, a small, leather-faced man of 58. He has been waiting for days to hear about his many relatives who resided in the quake area. News out of the region has been agonizingly slow, and he says he can wait no longer.         ``I've been waiting to go since I heard,'' he said. ``I'm a bulldozer operator and they need me, but in the meantime my whole family of eight has given blood and donated all we can. I know in my heart that all of my relatives can't be alive, but what can I do but hope?''         According to Soviet news agencies, more than 3,000 people gave more than a ton of blood the day after the earthquake hit.         Phone lines to much of the area have been destroyed, but railroads and airplanes have been steadily shipping in supplies and transporting physicians, mountain-rescue specialists and other volunteers.         Republics across the country are also offering assistance. Alma-Ata in the Central Asian Republic of Kazakhstan has offered to take in 3,500 homeless. Tbilisi in Georgia has sent buses and ambulances.         But Moscow is the center of the Soviet Union, and that is where much of the aid is being coordinated from.         The Komsomol, a youth league, has already sent in 370 volunteers and is planning to send in as many more today. The group has already sent in 5 tons of goods, including clothes and medicine.         Scores of people stood outside in a steady snowfall, volunteering to travel to the disaster site. They were finally turned away by a party official, who announced that the area is already full and only specialized help is needed.         Officials at both Komsomol and the embassy say cranes designed to work well in mountainous terrain are badly needed because many people are still trapped beneath rubble and temperatures are expected to reach below freezing in the area today.         Several of the shelter workers wore black arm bands and black scarves were attached to the red government flags that hang from many government buildings here.         Three bank accounts have been set up, one that accepts hard currency. The Church of Moscow has already donated more than 1 million rubles and is expected to give at least as much in the coming days.         A benefit concert was to be held in a large Moscow sports arena, and the local newspaper has produced an edition double its usual size and price, with proceeds going to disaster relief.         Several lifetime Moscow residents said the disaster has received more coverage in the Soviet press than any other event in modern history. One Soviet writer/translator said he has never seen an outpouring of help such as this.         ``Never before would people be going door to door collecting clothing and goods. Before, the government would not allow them to,'' he said.         Gureghian, who was to lead a special Mass today for the dead, injured and homeless, said he, too, has been overwhelmed by the response.         ``We cannot express our gratitude to the Russian and the other people of the United States for what they are doing,'' he said. ``Now we must be strong.'Caption:  PHOTO MAPCITY WAS DESTROYED - POPULATION: 250,000; SPITAK: COMPLETELY LEVELED - POPULATION: 30,000; KIROVAKAN: HALF OF BUILDINGS HAVE CRUMBLED - POPULATION: 150,000.ALAN BERNER / SEATTLE TIMES: TWO WOMEN WEEP AT THE ARMENIAN EMBASSY IN MOSCOW AFTER DELIVERING CLOTHING TO BE SENT TO EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS IN ARMENIA.PAUL SOUTAR / KNIGHT-RIDDER TRIBUNE NEWS: MAP SHOWING LOCATION OF ARMENIAN EARTHQUAKE NOT AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC VERSION.
