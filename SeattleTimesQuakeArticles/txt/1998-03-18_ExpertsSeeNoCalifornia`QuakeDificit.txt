LOS ANGELES - The accepted notion that there are too few earthquakes in Southern California for all the stress building on its faults was based on shaky research, scientists now say.    Those who warned just three years ago of the "quake deficit" now admit they erred because their conclusions were based on an incomplete history of regional quakes.    Back in 1995, the Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities compared the record of quakes since 1850 with the models and concluded there should be nearly twice as many moderate to large quakes as they found.    But two researchers who went back to the data say they got a more accurate picture when they restricted their analysis to just those quakes observed since 1903. They assumed records would likely be more complete after the turn of the century because Southern California had relatively few inhabitants before then.    With the smaller, more focused study, they calculated that the rate of quakes larger than magnitude 6 was much closer to what the models predicted, Thomas Hanks, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Menlo Park, said yesterday.     Hanks was to present the findings today to the annual meeting of the Seismological Society of America in Boulder, Colo. The paper has been accepted for publication in the summer issue of the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America.    Ross Stein, a USGS geophysicist and study co-author, said the new findings, which pinpoint flaws in a document used for state earthquake policy, hold important implications for earthquake insurance, which is based in part on the size and frequency of quakes.    Edward Field of the University of Southern California and David Jackson of the University of California at Los Angeles - a principal author of the 1995 report - were scheduled today to present a new mathematical model that also finds no quake deficit.
