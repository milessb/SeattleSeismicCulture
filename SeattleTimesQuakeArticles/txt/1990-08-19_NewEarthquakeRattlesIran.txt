NICOSIA, Cyprus - An earthquake measuring 5.4 on the Richter scale shook northeastern Iran yesterday, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or destruction.        Scores of sharp aftershocks have rolled through the country since the June 21 earthquake that destroyed a large swath of northwestern Iran, killing almost 40,000 people and wounded tens of thousands.
