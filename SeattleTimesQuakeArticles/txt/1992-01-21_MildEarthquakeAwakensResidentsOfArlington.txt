ARLINGTON A minor earthquake shook Arlington residents out of bed yesterday, but apparently caused no damage or injuries.     The quake, measuring 3.4 on the Richter scale, had its epicenter three miles east of Arlington, according to measurements at the University of Washington's seismology lab, said geophysics researcher Chris Jonientz-Trisler. The main tremor occurred at 8:35 a.m., followed by numerous less-powerful aftershocks.     Snohomish County sheriff's Sgt. Sam Goss said deputies had many reports of residents hearing explosions.
