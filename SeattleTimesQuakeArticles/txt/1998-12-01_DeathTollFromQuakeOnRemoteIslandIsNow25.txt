JAKARTA - Rescue teams searched for survivors trapped in destroyed buildings as the death toll from a powerful earthquake that hit a remote island in Indonesia rose to 25 today.    The magnitude-6.5 quake struck Mangole island, about 1,180 miles northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, Sunday night, triggering landslides, cutting roads and sending homes sliding into the sea.    Widespread damage was also reported on neighboring Taliabu island.    Local officials said more than 150 people were injured and 858 buildings were damaged on both islands. Mangole's main government buildings were flattened.
