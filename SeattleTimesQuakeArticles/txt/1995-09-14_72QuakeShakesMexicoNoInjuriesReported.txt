MEXICO CITY  - A strong earthquake shook Mexico City and much of southern Mexico this morning, sending people running out of homes and children scrambling from classrooms.    Buildings in Mexico City swayed shortly after 8 a.m. (7 a.m. PDT). The quake lasted about one minute.    The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 7.2, said Stuard Koyanagi of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. Mexico's National Seismological Service put it at 7.3.       The epicenter was in a rural area 190 miles south of Mexico City and 90 miles east of the resort city of Acapulco.          There were no reports of injuries or serious damage in Mexico City, said Carlos Sainz, director of the Civil Protection service - "only fright on the part of the population," some brief power outages and some broken windows, he said.    It struck almost 10 years to the day after the earthquake that killed more than 6,000 people on Sept. 19, 1985. That quake had a magnitude of 8.1.    In Mexico City, telephone lines swayed, electricity was knocked out in several neighborhoods and traffic stopped briefly as frightened motorists leaped from their cars and office workers fled from buildings into the streets.    Besides the capital, the quake was felt in the states of Guererro, Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz, Morelos and Michoacan, television reports said.    Most Mexican quakes have their epicenter off the coast of Guererro near Acapulco. Today's quake was felt in that resort, but firefighters and emergency officials reported no damage or injuries.    In Mexico City's upscale Condesa neighborhood, which is especially vulnerable to earthquakes, there were some broken windows, and some traffic signals went out.    A local radio station was broadcasting a program about the 1985 quake when it was interrupted by a wailing seismic alarm installed recently to give a brief warning before the shock waves from coastal quakes hit the capital.Caption:  MAPAP: EARTHQUAKES EPICENTER (MAP NOT AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY)
