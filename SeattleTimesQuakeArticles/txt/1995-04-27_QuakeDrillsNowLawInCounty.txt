King County must hold a surprise earthquake drill sometime during the last four months of the year, as part of an ordinance approved this week by the Metropolitan King County Council.     The exercise will assess any changes to the county's disaster response made after yesterday's "Sound Shake '95" drills.     The ordinance calls for:      --  A long-range plan to ensure that county government can continue to operate and provide services during a major disaster.     --  A regionwide command structure to clarify who is in charge.     --  A countywide disaster training and education plan, including at least three emergency-preparedness seminars each school year for teachers and school administrators.     --  Support for the Red Cross' distribution of emergency-shelter supplies to local facilities, including schools.     --  A new earthquake and disaster guidebook for citizens and county employees.      In Bellevue, officials are working on recovery plans after yesterday's drill - a simulated quake that registered 8 on the Richter.     From an emergency-operations center in Crossroads, representatives of all Bellevue city departments coordinated responses to reports of simulated damage and casualties, which included severe damage to several schools, a large hardware store, and the Meydenbauer reservoir.     Initial indications are that although city officials communicated well, communications should be accelerated
