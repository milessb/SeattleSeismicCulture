MEXICO CITY _ A team of experts searching for a 9-year-old boy missing since the Sept. 19 earthquake said yesterday ``there is no possibility of life'' under the rubble believed to be covering the child        The team used listening devices to try to pick up sounds after heavy equipment had removed some of the debris.        Julian Abed, an engineer working with the search team that spent more than two hours in the ruins yesterday afternoon, told reporters, ``Certainly there is no possibility of life.''        Abed said workers would continue searching at the site with machinery and by hand, but the effort to reach the boy through tunneling into the debris would be suspended.        He said the listening equipment the team had used was capable of detecting even a tiny pulsation.        Earlier in the afternoon, a crane and an earth mover that had been brought to the site to remove some of the chunks of concrete were pulled back and their engines turned off for the search team to listen for any sounds.        Rescuers were pessimistic that the boy, Luis Ramon Navarrete Maldonado, could have survived the 16 days since the massive quake with little, if any, water or food.        ``Every minute counts against us,'' said Mexico City Police Chief Ramon Mota Sanchez.        Shorty before dawn, Jorge Rangel, a Mexican engineer, said searchers had reached the site where it had been believed the boy was trapped with his grandfather, but no one was found. They then turned their attention to other locations.        Rangel said no water was found in the ruins of the old multifamily dwelling in the downtown district. The day before, another rescue worker said there was an old cistern in the building and water might have trickled down to the child.        Searchers have said they heard tapping sounds in response to questions asked of the child, leading them to believe the boy was alive.         On Friday, one worker reported the boy had responded verbally to a question asked by searchers, but Mota Sanchez discounted the report, saying there had been no voice contact.        Still, the police chief said noises were heard from under the rubble at 6:30 a.m. (5:30 a.m. PDT) yesterday.        Rescue workers appeared increasingly reluctant to describe the sounds they heard, and Mota Sanchez said later they could have come from falling stones or dirt.        An early morning landslide damaged the tunnels workers had dug with picks, shovels and their hands to try to reach the child, Mota Sanchez said.        A crane then was brought to the site to tear back the concrete slabs and other rubble blocking the rescue efforts.        Mota Sanches said authorities did not want to risk the lives of the rescue workers in the tunnels.         The last known survivors of the earthquake, which may have killed as many as 8,000 people according to unofficial estimates, were rescued about a week ago.        Meanwhile, reports in local Mexican newspapers said the Treasury Ministry told international bankers recently that, even before the earthquake, Mexico needed an additional $500 million this year and $4 billion in 1986.        The additional need was spelled out by the ministry in a message sent to banks asking for postponement of a $950 million principal payment on its foreign debt of $96.4 billion.Caption:  PHOTOAP: MAURICIO NAVARRETE, IN BILLED HAT, WAITS FOR NEWS OF HIS SON OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE WHERE THE YOUNGSTER IS BELIEVED TO BE TRAPPED.
