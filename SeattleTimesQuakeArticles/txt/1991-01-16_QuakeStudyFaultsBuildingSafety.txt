KELSO         The Cowlitz County Administration Building in Kelso probably would not withstand the force of an earthquake and might injure or kill people as it fell apart, a new study says.        The building is in two sections: one built in 1923 and the other in 1939. During an earthquake, the two sections would shake independently, ripping apart at the seam and then knocking into each other, according to the $20,000 study by the Vancouver engineering firm of Kramer Gehlen & Associates.        County commissions say they are taking the problem seriously but aren't sure whether renovations to the existing building would suffice or whether a new building is required.        The consultants recommended spending $400,000 to tie the two buildings together with dowels and reinforce the walls at the stairwells and the common wall so they  are like one building.
