NFL owners will get off the sideline and wade into the Seahawk standoff next week when they get lessons on seismology and the Kingdome during the league's annual meeting.     "Particularly the seismic risk issue," NFL spokesman Joe Browne said yesterday.     Seahawk and King County officials have been invited to argue their cases to two owners' committees.     NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue will brief the owners on his meetings with owner Ken Behring and Seattle officials last month. Behring may address the group and answer questions during the closed session.     And owners may vote to change a 20-year-old policy barring owners from also having stakes in "competing" professional sports, such as basketball, baseball and hockey. A rule change could clear a potential obstacle for Seattle billionaire and Portland Trail Blazer owner Paul Allen, should he buy the franchise.     NFL officials do not expect a vote on Behring's attempt to relocate the team to Los Angeles. That could happen as early as next month when Behring probably still will be embroiled in litigation with King County, if he doesn't sell the team by then. The owners will meet from Monday through Thursday in West Palm Beach, Fla., and vote on relocations involving Cleveland and Houston.     Browne said yesterday during a conference call with reporters that King County Executive Gary Locke and Behring have been invited to give their sides of the controversy surrounding the Kingdome.     Both sides have filed suit. Behring announced the franchise was leaving Seattle on Feb. 2, saying the Kingdome is seismically unsafe and has not been maintained as a "first-class facility," as required by his lease. He says he has lost millions because of it.    King County claims the stadium is safe and that Behring was more interested in moving than working with the renovation process.     The lawsuit is tied up in a state Supreme Court appeal to be argued March 27.    A meeting between county officials and Behring in California yesterday was an indirect product of Tagliabue's advice to both sides last month.      The commissioner told Locke and Councilman Pete von Reichbauer they needed to work toward a settlement.          Von Reichbauer asked for the meeting and Behring said he accepted as a courtesy to the officials and Tagliabue.     Locke and von Reichbauer were both conciliatory and vague when they returned last night from Behring's community of Blackhawk, near Oakland.  They declined to discuss any issue of substance, but said their mission was to tone down the rhetoric and get negotiations going.     Behring issued a similar statement, saying he appreciated the chance to re-emphasize his concerns about the Kingdome lease and also hoped a trial could be avoided.     Tagliabue met with Behring on Feb. 21 and later met with county officials and Seattle businessman John Nordstrom, whose family sold the team to Behring in 1988.      Browne said Tagliabue would discuss his understanding of the stalemate during his opening briefing on league issuers to owners Monday.     The owners' finance committee is expected to issue a report and possibly call for a vote on whether to alter the cross-ownership ban to accommodate Miami Dolphin owner H. Wayne Huizenga, who also owns baseball's Florida Marlins and hockey's Florida Panthers.      Huizenga has held the team in trust since 1994, while the committee studied whether to lift the ban.    A change could also ease any ownership bid by Allen.      Although Behring insists the team is not for sale, he has kept his options open, exchanging financial information with Allen's representatives.     Behring moved equipment to Anaheim last month, but has been prevented by the King County lawsuit from entering any agreements to enable the team play elsewhere.
