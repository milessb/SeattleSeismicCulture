SAN JUAN — A strong earthquake under the Atlantic Ocean has shaken Puerto Rico’s northern coast, causing minor damage in some places. Dozens of people reported fallen items in their home and feeling buildings sway in the capital of San Juan, about 59 miles from the quake’s epicenter.  The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.5 and struck just after midnight about 34 miles north of Hatillo. It said the quake occurred 17 miles deep. Puerto Rico’s emergency management agency said there was no tsunami warning.  Sunday marked the fourth anniversary of the devastating earthquake in nearby Haiti that killed more than 300,000 people.
