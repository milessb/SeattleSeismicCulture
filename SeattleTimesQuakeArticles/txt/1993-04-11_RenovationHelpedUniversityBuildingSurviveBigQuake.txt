SALEM, Ore. - Forty-six window panes were cracked in Willamette University's Waller Hall by the March 25 earthquake, but the recent renovation of the 126-year-old building may have saved it.    Of the $2.6 million spent by the university to restore the building in 1989, $500,000 went into work to enable the building to withstand an earthquake measuring 6 on the Richter scale. The March 25 quake measured 5.6.    Contractors excavated beneath the building, poured large concrete footings and erected a steel frame resting on columns on those footings. They also reglued all the bricks on the outside walls. Not one of those bricks came loose in the quake.
