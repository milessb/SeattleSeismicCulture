EUREKA, Calif. — Officials say a powerful magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck Sunday night off the coast of Northern California, but there were no early signs of a tsunami. The quake was felt as far south as the Bay Area and as far north as Oregon.  The U.S. Geological Survey says the temblor struck at 9:18 p.m. PDT about four miles beneath the Pacific seabed and about 50 miles west of Eureka.  The Humboldt County Sheriff’s Department, which oversees most of the populated areas near the quake, said there have been no calls about damages or injuries.  According to the USGS, the quake was felt over a large swath of the North Coast as well as other parts of Northern California.  USGS seismologist Susan Hoover said more than 300 people reported feeling the temblor on their website.  Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had not issued a tsunami watch or advisory last night.
