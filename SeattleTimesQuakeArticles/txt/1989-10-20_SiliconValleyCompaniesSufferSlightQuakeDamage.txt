SAN FRANCISCO - A relieved Silicon Valley, the center of the nation's computer industry, went back to work yesterday with little of the extensive damage sustained in surrounding areas.        ``Most companies are reporting superficial damage, such as plaster cracks and falling ceiling tiles,'' said Jeanne Alford, spokeswoman for the Semiconductor Industry Association of Cupertino, Calif.        Many of the companies closed down Wednesday to check for damage from the quake, then called employees back to work yesterday, Alford said.        The damage appears to have been fairly limited because most of the buildings are low-rise, relatively new and up to the most recent safety codes, Alford said.        ``Very few of the buildings are more than 15 years old,'' she said. ``They tend to be built to take a lot of vibration.''        Alford also noted that the damage may have been relatively minimal because the Silicon Valley, which stretches for about 25 miles south of the San Francisco Bay, is solid ground rather than landfill.        The two areas that sustained the greatest damage from the earthquake - the Marina district in San Francisco and the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland - were built on landfill.        A spokeswoman for another trade group said there were no reports of computer businesses losing data because of the earthquake.        ``Their systems are designed with this kind of event in mind,'' said Cheryl Vifaus of the American Electronics Association in Santa Clara, Calif.        Analysts agreed that the computer companies would not suffer long-term damage. ``Even if there were extensive damage, the companies tend to be heavily insured,'' said Lawrence Harris of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles.        Two major chip companies, Intel Corp. of Santa Clara and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. of Sunnyvale, said that they had sustained minimal damage and that virtually all of their employees were back at work yesterday.        The Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Alto said that one or two of its 75 buildings in the region may be too damaged to occupy immediately. Most of the personal-computer maker's 22,500 northern California employees were working yesterday.        ``Our damage estimate is very preliminary, but we expect it will be at least $1 million,'' said Hewlett-Packard spokesman Roy Verley.
