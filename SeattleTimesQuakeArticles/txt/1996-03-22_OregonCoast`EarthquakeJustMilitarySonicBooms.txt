PORTLAND - Military jets  rocked northwestern Oregon with a pair of thunderous sonic booms yesterday, panicking some coastal residents.    The noises were caused by three Oregon Air National Guard F-15 fighter jets and two Air Force B-1 bombers that had joined a military exercise off the coast. The Navy said  the exercise also involved three ships firing missiles 45 miles offshore.    "We're really sorry for scaring anybody," said an Air National Guard spokeswoman.    The jets were 100 miles offshore, but atmospheric conditions apparently amplified the sound.
