YINGXIU, China — U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday surveyed recovery efforts at one of the towns hit hardest by China's May 12 earthquake, telling Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao that "the whole world stands behind you and supports you." Domestic and foreign donations for relief efforts have reached $3.7 billion, with 15 countries contributing 1,000 tons of aid materials and $72 million as of Wednesday. Meanwhile, Chinese officials in charge of workplace and environmental safety say teams have dealt with thousands of "hidden dangers," averting secondary disasters such as chemical and radiation leaks in Sichuan province and surrounding areas rocked by the 7.9-magnitude quake. Wang Dexue, vice minister of the State Administration of Work Safety, said production has stopped at 279 mines and chemical enterprises, which will need to pass government safety checks before resuming operations. Most of the mines are small, and the total capacity lost by their shutdown is not expected to affect China's overall output of coal. The official death toll jumped to 60,560, with 26,221 people listed as missing. "It may further climb to a level of 70,000, 80,000 or more," Wen, the premier, told reporters. Nearly half the residents of one town, Yingxiu, were killed or are listed as missing. The steeply winding road to Yingxiu had reopened, and Saturday the town was crawling with members of the People's Armed Police and the People's Liberation Army, provincial health disinfection teams, forensic scientists and civilian volunteers trying to impose order. On the main street, soldiers lined up with shovels and black body bags at the ready, while bulldozers shoved debris. Teams in white bodysuits combed the town, and visitors — and their cars — were sprayed with disinfectant on departure. Soldiers shot some abandoned, hungry dogs to put them out of their misery.
