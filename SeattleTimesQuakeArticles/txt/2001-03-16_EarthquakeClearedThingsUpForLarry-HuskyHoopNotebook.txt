GAINESVILLE, Fla.--The day five years ago that Wendy Larry interviewed for the women's basketball head coaching job at the University of Washington, an earthquake rattled Seattle. So Larry, the Old Dominion coach of 14 years who removed herself from the list of UW coaching candidates in May of 1996, had to bring up natural disasters during yesterday's news conference at the O'Connell Center. "I know they have earthquakes out there (in Seattle)," Larry said. "I also know that they have a good tradition of women's basketball and tremendous athletic department support." Larry stayed at her alma mater, Old Dominion, but left Seattle with her own impressions of the UW women's program. "They were making a change. I was looking at an opportunity to go to a program (Washington) that was making an upgrade and also had a female athletic director (Barbara Hedges)," Larry recalled. "It helped that there was an earthquake out there on my interview, and that made my decision easier."
