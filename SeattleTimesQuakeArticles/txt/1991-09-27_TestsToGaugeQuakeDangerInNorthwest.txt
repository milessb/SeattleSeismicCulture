SALEM, Ore. - Researchers were to set up hundreds of seismic instruments in the Willamette Valley beginning today in an effort to learn more about earthquake hazards in the Northwest.     The test will involve installing 500 to 700 instruments in long lines, then setting off small explosive charges and measuring the resulting seismic waves.     It's hoped that the work will help form a picture of underground formations that could cause earthquakes.     The effort began last week, when the instruments were set up along the eastern edge of the Puget Basin from southern British Columbia to a point near Mount Rainier.
