The devastating earthquake that hit the Soviet Union Wednesday struck in an extremely complex geological region that in many ways resembles much of the Los Angeles Basin, according to scientists familiar with the area        The driving force in both places is the convergence of giant tectonic plates - massive slabs of the Earth's crust that support the continents and the oceans.         Although the Soviet situation is more complicated than Southern California's, both systems create pockets of high seismic stress because of compression of the land, several experts said.        The result is the creation of hidden earthquake faults similar to those discovered in the last year in the Los Angeles Basin. Lurking several miles beneath the surface, these ``thrust'' faults cause earthquakes when one side of the fault is pushed over the other in a process that releases enough energy to level cities.         The epicenter of the Soviet quake was in the Caucasus Mountains, on the border between Armenia and Soviet Georgia about 25 miles from the Turkish border, in a region laced with minor faults and dormant volcanoes.        Because quakes in that area occur on faults close to the surface, they often are far more damaging than their size would suggest, said acting California State Geologist Brian Tucker, who spent two years studying the seismology of the area near where the earthquake struck.        Several experts compared the Soviet region with Southern California, but there are significant differences.        In both places the land is compressed because plates are pressing against each other,   said Mansour Niazi, an Iranian geophysicist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif.        The primary manifestation of that process in Southern California is the San Andreas Fault, but there is no counterpart to that in that area of the Soviet Union.        ``There are no defined lines of seismicity,'' Niazi said. ``It is very diffused.''        Thus, it is much more difficult to know exactly where earthquakes will strike there.        Geologists say the area is particularly subject to earthquakes because it sits at a boundary of four tectonic plates.        The individual plates are irregularly shaped and vary greatly in size. All of them are in motion, and it is at the edges of the plates that earthquakes and volcanos tend to occur.        Armenia sits at the southern edge of the giant Eurasian plate, where the Arabian, Indian and Iran plates are relentlessly moving northward and forcing themselves under the Eurasian plate, raising mountain ranges and wreaking havoc.        The Caucasus Mountains, where this earthquake was centered, are the result of this movement.          ``The mountains are there as living testimony to the fact that a collision is occurring,'' said Roger Bilham, a geology professor at the University of Colorado.        The process has been going on for millions of years, geologists said, and earthquakes are inevitable in the region.             The area has been the site of many disastrous earthquakes in this century. A temblor in September 1978 in Tabas, Iran, with a magnitude 7.7 on the Richter scale killed 25,000 people, while a magnitude 7.9 quake in Erzincan, Turkey, in December 1939 killed 30,000. Other earthquakes in this century in the area have killed from 1,300 to 12,000 people.         George Purcaru of the Institute of Geophysics and Seismology in Frankfurt, West Germany,  said ``there is good evidence'' that the region could generate a much greater quake - one at least as strong as the one that nearly destroyed San Francisco in 1906.Caption:  MAPAP: TECTONIC WORLD PLATES -- THE EARTH'S CRUST IS DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL PLATES.
