SAN FRANCISCO â€” A 5.2-magnitude earthquake hit the San Francisco Bay Area last night, shaking up hockey and baseball fans and knocking out phone service in parts of San Jose. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was centered three miles southwest of Gilroy, outside San Jose. No significant damage was reported. Buildings rumbled in Watsonville, about 100 miles south of San Francisco. The quake jolted the Compaq Center in San Jose where the San Jose Sharks were playing the Colorado Avalanche in a National Hockey League playoff game. The upper stands of the arena shook strongly for about 10 seconds and light fixtures continued to sway for several seconds afterward. The game continued. "It was a pretty good swing," said a phone operator at the Hyatt Regency in San Francisco who was flooded with calls from guests. The quake also jolted Pacific Bell Park during a game between the Atlanta Braves and San Francisco Giants, but play continued. The stadium sound system played Jerry Lee Lewis' song "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On."
