TACOMA - The Tacoma Narrows Bridge will be shaking this weekend.    Researchers plan to run 50,000-pound trucks filled with gravel across the bridge to simulate earthquake trauma. The mile-long span will be closed from midnight to 5 a.m. Saturday and Sunday for the test, the culmination of a week of study.    Since Monday, a team from Johns Hopkins University has been trying to determine how the bridge would stand up to an earthquake.    The week marks the second phase of a three-stage study that includes a computer analysis of the earthquake impact, the simulated trauma and wind and vehicle effects recorded this week, and a comparison of the two. Results are expected in October.
