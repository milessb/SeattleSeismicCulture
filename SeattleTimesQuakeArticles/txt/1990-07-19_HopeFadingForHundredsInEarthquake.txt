BAGUIO, Philippines - Rescue crews and relief supplies trickled into this stricken resort and university city yesterday as hope faded for hundreds of people believed trapped under collapsed buildings as a result of Monday's earthquake        Figures compiled by the Office of Civil Defense and Red Cross showed at least 490 people were killed and 1,000 injured in the quake. Officials said two U.S. citizens were among the dead.        Medical officials warned of possible epidemics as tens of thousands of residents huddled for a third day in tattered tents and makeshift shelters in parks and streets. Drenched by daily rains, many complained that they had no food, water or medicine.        By yesterday, doctors working under umbrellas and sheets of plastic had treated nearly 800 of the injured in muddy outdoor areas. The city's three hospitals were all damaged and without power. Aftershocks continued    throughout the day.        Silence lay across Baguio, a city of 200,000 people, as grief-stricken families watched while rescuers searched for survivors in the rubble of two hotels, the Hyatt Terraces and the Nevada.        Without electric power, the work stopped as daylight faded. Almost no rescue operations were evident at the 20 other hotels and at schools, office buildings and factories brought down by the quake. Hundreds of homes also were damaged or destroyed. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   SENDING AID         Seattle-area Filipino-American associations plan a money-raising talent show and are accepting contributions to aid survivors of the earthquake.
