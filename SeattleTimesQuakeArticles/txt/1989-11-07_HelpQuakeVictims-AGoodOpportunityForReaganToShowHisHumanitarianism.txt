Editor, The Times:         Mr. (ex-President) Reagan recently suggested that American citizens should reach into their pockets to help the earthquake-stricken people in the Bay Area.         I can think of no nobler, shining example than for the ex-governor of California to donate the $2 million he received from the Japanese Fuji Corporation. What a glorious way to kick off a humanitarian fund-raiser!    - Lisbeth Pisk, SeattlCaption:  ILLUSTRATIONMIKE LUCKOVICH / ATLANTA CONSTITUTION: ILLUSTRATIONS OF PRESIDENT REAGAN AS A ``SPORTSCASTER'' ``MOVIE STAR'' ``PRESIDENT'' AND A ``GEISHA''.
