A major earthquake is expected to hit Washington in the near future, but officials say residents here deal with disasters so infrequently they would be ill-prepared to handle such an ordeal.         ``We don't have the daily or monthly need of handling disasters like other parts of the country, so there is a lack of preparedness,'' says Phil Cogan of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.         ``Prepare to care for yourself for at least 72 hours. Apathy kills hundreds of people in earthquakes. We tend not to listen to warnings. Mexico helps us wake up in Washington state and prepare.''         Linda Nosen, a seismologist with the University of Washington's geophysics program, agreed with Cogan as she announced that Washington is due for a major earthquake that may register 6.5 to 7.5 on the Richter scale.         Washington's last major quake was in 1949, measuring 7.1. The last significant earthquake in the Puget Sound area occurred in 1965 and measured 6.5 on the scale. That quake caused seven deaths and $12.5 million damage statewide.         To help people survive an earthquake, state officials and representatives of the Red Cross and FEMA provided the following safety tips:      Preparing for an earthquake:         Bolt down or provide other strong support for water heaters and gas appliances. Use flexible connections wherever possible.         Know where and how to shut off electricity, gas and water at main switches and valves.         Place large and heavy objects on lower shelves. Brace or anchor high or top-heavy objects.         Keep on hand a portable radio with extra batteries; flashlight; first-aid kit; first-aid book; fire extinguisher; adjustable wrench for turning off gas and water; non-electric can opener; portable stove, such as butane or charcoal (use butane only when there is no gas leak and charcoal outdoors so there is no carbon-monoxide poisoning), and matches.         Also store bottled water in airtight containers and replace it about every six months. Store at least three gallons of water per person for up to 72 hours. Keep canned and dried foods sufficient for a week for each family member. Both food and water should be rotated into normal meals to keep them fresh. Canned goods have a normal shelf-life of one year.      During an earthquake:         Stay calm.         If you're indoors, stay indoors and stand in a doorway or crouch under a desk or table away from windows or glass dividers. If you're outside, stay outdoors and stand away from buildings, trees and telephone and electric lines.         If on the road, drive away from underpasses or overpasses, stop in a safe area and stay in your vehicle.      After an earthquake:         Check for injuries and provide first aid.         Check for gas or water leaks, sewage breaks or downed electric lines. Check for building damage and potential safety problems (such as damaged chimneys) during aftershocks.         Clean up dangerous spills.         Wear shoes.         Turn on radio and listen for instructions from public-safety agencies.         Don't use the telephone except for emergencies.         Do not eat or drink anything from open containers near shattered glass.
