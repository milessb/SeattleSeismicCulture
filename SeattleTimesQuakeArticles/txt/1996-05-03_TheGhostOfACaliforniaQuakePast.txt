It only took a second. One second of swaying floors and flickering lights. One second of grabbing the doorjamb and hearing my heart thump inside my chest.     One second and I was back in Northridge, Calif., in January 1994, being thrown out of bed before dawn.     As I crouched in the doorway of my Queen Anne apartment last night, I flashed back to the most terrifying experience of my life:      The thunderous bang-bang-bang, as if a giant had picked up my building to shake out its contents. The cracking of the apartment walls, the crashing of plates in the kitchen. The thud of everything on my shelves falling to the ground. The wailing of a woman from somewhere high in the Hollywood Hills.     The images came back like a fast-motion dream. Bodies being pulled from the pancaked apartment building. Highways that suddenly went nowhere. Thousands of people with nowhere to go and nothing to eat, sleeping in the parks or in parking lots behind grocery stores. Children who didn't want to return to school. Toppled chimneys, broken fences, ruined libraries. Piles of rubble. The mess, the chaos, the misery.     The fear came rushing back, too. That intense, paralyzing fear that dries your mouth and stabs your gut. This is it, this is the one, I thought. They said it would come. Where are my loved ones? What will happen to them? What will happen to me?     I rose from my crouch. My bookcase was still standing. Nothing had fallen, nothing broke. The lights were still on, the phone still worked.     It was over. The quake that triggered my flashback couldn't even compete with the aftershocks of the Northridge quake.     Somehow, it didn't matter. An hour later, I was still shaking.
