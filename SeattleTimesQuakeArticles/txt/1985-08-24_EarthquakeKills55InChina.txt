PEKING (AP) _ An earthquake near the Chinese-Soviet border killed 55 people in Wuqia, western China, flattened 85 percent of the houses in the town and severed communications, the state seismological bureau said today        The quake measured 7.4 on the Richter scale, said a bureau spokeswoman.        The jolt claimed 19 lives in Wuqia county and 36 on Wupar commune in neighboring Shufu county, said Zhu Lingren, deputy director of the Xinjiang Seismological Bureau in the regional capital of Urumqi.        ``Eighty-Five percent of the houses in the county seat of Wuqia were flattened. But the quake area is sparsely populated and mainly pastoral,'' he said. ``There's no figure on the injured. People have moved out of their houses and are now living in the open.''        Wuqia is about 80 miles northwest of Kashgar, which has a population of about 300,000. Kashgar was an important stop on the ancient Central Asian silk road.
