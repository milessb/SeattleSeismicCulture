GOLF        Betsy King salvaged a 2-under-par 70 and a one-shot lead yesterday in a Women's U.S. Open Golf Championship that has been plagued by fire, flood, storm and earthquake.        ``This is going to become a Tour story,'' King predicted after she survived a 2-hour, 17-minute storm delay and posted a 213 total for three rounds of the weather-plagued 41st American national championship in Kettering, Ohio.        ``I can see us, 10 years from now, saying, `You remember back in '86 when we had all the weather, and the fire and the earthquake'?'' King said of the elements and events that have overshadowed the golf.        They have included:         The fire. Noxious fumes of burning phosphorus from a derailed tanker that forced the evacuation of some 30,000 people in nearby Miamisburg, Ohio, and chased some players from their hotel rooms.         The flood. Rains from a severe thunderstorm yesterday which flooded portions of the course, caused a long delay and, at one time raised questions whether the round could be completed before today.         The earthquake. That registered 4.2 on the Richter Scale in Lima, Ohio, yesterday; 60 miles away but strong enough to jolt players from their hotel beds.         The storms. A series of extremely strong thunderstorms that have disrupted play in each of the first three rounds. The latest was the strongest, with winds strong enough to knock down trees on the golf course.          Canadian Richard Zokol, taking advantage of faltering play by the leaders, shot a 4-under-par 67 for a two-stroke advantage after three rounds of the $500,000 Anheuser-Busch Classic in Williamsburg, Va.          Defending champion Don January birdied four of the final five holes to finish with a 6-under-par 66 and take the second-round lead in The Greenbrier senior tournament at White Sulphur Springs, W. Va.     BOXING           Evander Holyfield, a member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, won the WBA junior heavyweight crown by defeating Muhammed Qawi in Atlanta _ and pronounced himself, after 12 pro bouts, ready to fight for the heavyweight title.        ``I've been wanting to fight Michael Spinks since I got out of the Olympics,'' said Holyfield, who beat Qawi in a 15-round split decision.        Spinks is the International Boxing Federation heavyweight champion and Olympic medalist who twice defeated Larry Holmes to win and retain the IBF title.     HYDROS         The Squire Shop hydroplane, racing in Evansville, Ohio, as the Joe Ricci Spirit of America, became the sixth qualifier for today's Thunder on the Ohio Regatta. Three boats have yet to qualify _ Oh Boy! Oberto, which ran a lap at 101.983 and thus failed to meet the 105-mph standard; Jerry Hopp's Thor Racing Team, and Miss Liberty (formerly Tempus), which ran a lap of 95 mph with Jack Schafer driving.         The Miller American, Miss Budweiser-turbine, and U-22 Risley's Express will be in Heat 1A today. Heat 1B will have Holset-Miss Madison, Spirit of America and Miss 7-Eleven. Chip Hanauer in the Miller American is the top qualifier after averaging 132.499 mph around the 2-mile course Friday.     TENNIS            Australian partners John Newcombe and Tony Roche, who won 12 Grand Slam doubles championships together, were inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I. American Chuck McKinley, Italian Nicola Pietrangeli and Britain's Ted Tinling and the late Dorothy Round Little also were inducted.      AUTO RACING         Two-time former world champion Nelson Piquet upstaged teammate and hometown favorite Nigel Mansell to gain the pole position for today's British Grand Prix. The Brazilian scorched the Brand's Hatch circuit in his Williams Honda at an average speed 140.536 mph to clock 1 minute, 6.961 seconds. Mansell, currently one point behind Frenchman Alain Prost in the drivers' championship, posted 1:07.399 to gain second place on the starting grid, also in a Williams Honda.     BICYCLES         French superstar Bernard Hinault won yesterday's Tour de France 38-mile time trial, advancing to third overall. Hinault was timed in 1 hour, 18 minutes, 46 seconds at an average speed of 29 mph, with his teammate, American Greg Lemond, second, 44 seconds slower.        Denmark's Jorgen Pederson was sixth overall in the stage to retain the yellow jersey as the overall leader.         Rebecca Twigg chased down an aggressive attack from Sara Neil of Winning-Peugeot to win the Wild Rose Prairie Road Race, part of the Washington Trust Classic in Spokane.        Twigg's winning time of 1:37:30 was matched by the second-place finisher, Katrin Tobin, and by Neil, who held on to take third place.         Roy Knickman slowed down to let his teammate, Steve Tilford, win the men's Manito Park Criterium.Caption:  PHOTONELSON PIQUETEVANDER HOLYFIELD
