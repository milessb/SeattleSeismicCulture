Almost half of the 25 thick concrete crossbeams in an elevated section of the Fauntleroy Expressway have cracks in them and a $1.2 million project to strengthen all of the beams will begin this fall.           The expressway connects the high-level West Seattle Bridge with 35th Avenue in West Seattle. The elevated section is 20 to 50 feet in the air and runs from the west end of the bridge to just west of Southwest Avalon Way. A busy route, it carries an average of 60,000 vehicles a day.           The cracks are small and do not pose any immediate danger to motorists, engineers say, but are an indication that part of the 25-year-old viaduct has moved very slightly because of stress. They are substantial enough to concern city engineers.           Another crack, 1/16th of an inch wide and about 4 feet long - considered large by engineers - was discovered in an annual inspection of the half-mile-long structure in January 1988. It was repaired soon afterward by the Seattle Engineering Department.           Subsequent inspections found that 11 of the big beams, which rest horizontally on columns under the deck of the four-lane roadway, have hairline cracks several feet long. Some of the beams are cracked in more than one place.           It is important that the cracks be repaired to keep moisture from corroding and rusting reinforcing steel in the beams, which would cause the viaduct to deteriorate faster.         ``The cracks are there because the beams have moved. They are the result of what we call an overstress in a member,'' said Ronald Nieforth, a city design engineer.           Gauges have been placed on some beams to determine whether the cracks are getting bigger, he said, but there has been no sign of further movement.           The elevated section was completed in mid-1965 and Nieforth said it is not considered to be particularly old. It was built, however, when structural standards for withstanding earthquakes were not nearly as stringent as they are today.           For instance, the adjoining West Seattle Bridge, completed in 1984, was built to much higher earthquake standards.           Bridges and viaducts are considered to be particularly vulnerable to damage or collapse in earthquakes, and Seattle has a considerable number of the structures. The mile-long, double-decked Nimitz Freeway in Oakland collapsed and killed 42 people in the strong quake which struck the San Francisco Bay area last October.           The Engineering Department has completed an assessment of major routes in Seattle that would be used by emergency vehicles in the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster here, and the Fauntleroy Expressway is rated as among those of first importance, said Steve Ferkovich, a structural design official in the department.           A proposal to rate the ability of such structures to withstand earthquakes has also been made by the department, but eight months after the big California temblor, the city has still not begun such an assessment. The first phase of it would cost $750,000, Ferkovich said.           The strengthening of the beams in the expressway's elevated section will enhance its ability to carry heavy loads, but will not increase its resistance to an earthquake, he and other engineering officials said.           The project will involve drilling holes in the 8-foot-thick beams, which weigh from 148 to 235 tons, then inserting long steel bars to bind the concrete together. An epoxy grout will be used to seal the cracks.           It will be difficult to position crews and equipment on the beams under the roadway deck, while contending with traffic both on the expressway and below it, and the job is expected to take up to a year to complete, Ferkovich said. The city hopes there will be little effect on traffic, but some lane closures may be required.          To pay for the project, the city is borrowing money from a fund set up by the state for public-works projects, a move approved by the City Council last month.Caption:  PHOTOGREG GILBERT / SEATTLE TIMES: THIS VIEW OF THE WEST SEATTLE ELEVATED EXPRESSWAY, LOOKING EAST FROM AVALON WAY, SHOWS THE GENERAL AREA WHERE THE SEATTLE CITY ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT WILL SPEND $1.2 MILLION TO STRENGTHENIT BECAUSE CRACKS WERE DISCOVERED
