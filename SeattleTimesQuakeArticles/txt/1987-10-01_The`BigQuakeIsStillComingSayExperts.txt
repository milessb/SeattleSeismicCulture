The frequent earthquakes that strike Southern California are a result of the inexorable pressure building along the San Andreas Fault and other smaller fault lines.        Seismologists now say there is a 50 percent chance that a great quake, one measuring 8 or more on the Richter scale, will strike along the southern San Andreas Fault within the next 30 to 50 years.        Earthquakes such as the one that struck Los Angeles today can relieve pressure on the fault temporarily, but do not stop the build-up to the predicted massive earthquake.        The San Andreas has snapped several times before, in prehistoric times and in relatively recent times. A large earthquake struck Southern California in 1857, and the great San Francisco earthquake hit along the San Andreas in 1906.        The pressure is caused as gigantic pieces of the Earth's crust grind against one another at their edges.        The San Andreas Fault is the point where the so-called Pacific plate, underlying the Pacific Ocean, drags northwest past the North American plate at a speed of some 3 inches per year.        A great quake on the fault could kill up to 14,000 people, seriously injure more than 50,000 and cause perhaps $17 billion in damage, federal officials have estimated.
