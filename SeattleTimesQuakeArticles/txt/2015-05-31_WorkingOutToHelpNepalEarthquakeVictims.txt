Fit & Fun Northcore Performance Training hosts open weekly group workouts with the Nepal earthquake in mind. The sessions, from 8 to 9 a.m. each Saturday through June, ask for $10 donations to the American Red Crossâ€™ relief fund.  All exercise levels are welcome and no registration is required.  After June 27, Northcore owner Jeff Millet plans to continue the Saturday morning workouts, but will switch the charities, chosen by members.  Northcore Performance Training is at 1501 N. 200th St., Shoreline. For more information, see northcoretraining.com.Caption:  Northcore owner Jeff Millet works with client Camille Robinson.
