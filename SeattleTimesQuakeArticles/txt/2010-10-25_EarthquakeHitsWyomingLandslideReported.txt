JACKSON, Wyo. â€” A magnitude 4.6 earthquake struck northwest Wyoming on Sunday, apparently triggering a landslide in Bridger-Teton National Forest about 20 miles northeast of Jackson. Heather Voster, a dispatcher at park headquarters in Moose, about 12 miles north of Jackson, said when the quake hit at about 11:45 a.m. she felt "just a mild shaking" that lasted less than 10 minutes.
