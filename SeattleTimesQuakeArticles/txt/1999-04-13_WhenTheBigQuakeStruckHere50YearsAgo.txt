The most powerful earthquake in the Pacific Northwest this century - a magnitude 7.1 - struck near Olympia 50 years ago today.      Felt throughout Western Washington and parts of Oregon and British Columbia, the quake killed eight people.     It was 11:55 a.m. Harvey Rosen, a second-grader at Lowell Elementary School in Tacoma, was headed to play soccer with his friends.      Other children were returning to play with their friends after lunch at home, and it was up to Marvin Klegman, a sixth-grader, to escort them safely across the street.      Harvey and Marvin walked out of the four-story brick school at the same time. "I turned left and he went right," Rosen recalled recently. Then the quake struck - and Marvin was buried underneath brick.     Harvey didn't immediately understand the magnitude of the event. "How I realized it was an earthquake I'll never know. How observant are you when you are 8 years old?"      What remains vivid in his mind, he said, is the vision of people pulling the brick and a piece of gutter off his dead schoolmate.     Kerry Klegman was in second grade when his older brother died.     "My brother was a very industrious guy," said Klegman, now an attorney in California. "Excellent student and a very friendly kid."      "I was very close to Marvin," he added. "I have pictures of us sitting together on the school steps."      The 1949 quake originated about 37 miles underground, said Bill Steele in the seismology lab at the University of Washington. Such quakes occur about every 35 years, he said. The most recent was a magnitude 6.5 in 1965 that also killed eight people.     "In all likelihood, we'll experience one or two of these in our lifetime," Steele said.     If a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit the Seattle area now, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates at least 2,000 people would be killed and at least 9,000 injured.     Triggered by tension on the Juan de Fuca plate, the deep quakes like the one in 1949 produce some of the strongest shaking, about 20 to 30 percent of the force of gravity, explained Steele. In such a quake, it's moderately difficult for an adult to remain standing.      But the force of such a quake is much less than in a "shallow crustal earthquake," or an earthquake occurring on one of the shallow faults in the Puget Sound area, Steele said.     Such quakes occurred in Kobe, Japan, in 1995, killing more than 6,300, and in Northridge, Calif., in 1994, killing 72 people.

Below are the magnitudes, dates and epicenters of the quakes:      --  7.1, April 13, 1949, near Olympia.     --  6.5, April 29, 1965, near Tacoma.     --  6.2, Nov. 13, 1939, near Bremerton.     --  6.0, 1909 (date unknown), near San Juan Islands.     --  5.0, Jan. 29, 1995, near Tacoma.Caption:  PHOTOSEATTLE TIMES FILES / 1949: FALLING MASONRY SMASHED CARS AT SECOND AVENUE AND YESLER WAY IN THE 1949 EARTHQUAKE, WHICH WAS A MAGNITUDE 7.1 AND KILLED EIGHT PEOPLE.
