VANCOUVER, B.C. - A shortage of stretchers, no place to put the dead and ambulance traffic jams were among the glitches that emerged during a mock drill of earthquake preparedness at three Vancouver hospitals        Officials from the Grace, Children's and University hospitals said they expect to be analyzing the results of last week's drill for months. But staff members, observers and drill planners said they were largely satisfied with the hospitals' performance.        ``We know that it would be worse in a real earthquake, but the staff performed very well and the systems worked well,'' said Maureen Oliver, director of nursing at University Hospital and one of the three main organizers of the drill.        Even before the Oct. 17, 1989, San Francisco Bay Area quake that killed 67 people, a joint committee from the hospitals had begun planning a response strategy in case a long-predicted earthquake strikes the Vancouver area.        The drill Wednesday afternoon involved every department in the three hospitals, as well as 100 volunteers made up to look and act like earthquake victims.        Studies of earthquakes show that gashes, cuts and open wounds, followed by fractures and breaks are the most common injuries. Heart failure, major medical problems and internal injuries are next, followed by head injuries, shock and burns. Smoke inhalation and psychiatric problems round out the list.        The organizers acknowledged that in a major quake, 100 injuries would be a very small number and that hospitals would be flooded with many more.        Planners deliberately decided not to cripple their resources by pretending the earthquake had damaged the hospitals themselves.        ``It wasn't realistic in that sense,'' Oliver said, ``because power failures, blackouts, water problems and food shortages and significant structural damage could happen.        ``But we were more interested in how we dealt with the disaster with our current capacity.''        Grace and Children's did, however, pretend their computers were down and had to keep track of all the admitted patients by paper.        In past drills, staffers had difficulty identifying each other in the crush to treat victims. This time, doctors wore bright yellow T-shirts, nurses white, porters orange, clerks blue, pharmacy mauve and security red.        In the event of a real quake, the shirts would be handed out quickly to keep confusion at a minimum.
