Pleas for aid for victims of last week's Mexican earthquake have brought a huge response from Seattle-area residents, according to one local relief worker.         ``We have had a higher response than in any emergency campaign we can remember,'' said Hope Tuttle, of the Seattle-King County Chapter of the American Red Cross. ``This has been an immediate and huge response. The individual amounts (of donations) aren't large, but there have been many, many of them.''         Tuttle said money donated to the Red Cross here goes directly and immediately to the Mexican Red Cross.         One noteworthy response, Tuttle said, came as a group effort by some students in Spanish classes at Cascade High School in Everett.         Teacher Debbie Cossey said students who had been studying the language and culture of Spanish-speaking countries decided to get involved and started a fund-raising drive. That effort raised more than $130 by the time it ended Thursday.         Alson collecting doations is the Northwest branch of the relief agency CARE. The group already has allocated $100,000 from national funds to be used in Mexico and will add individual contributions to that amount, said Peter Blomquist, a local representative.         Contributions of cash or checks for Mexican relief may be made to the following organizations:         ``Mexican Relief,'' Seattle-King County Chapter of the American Red Cross, P.O.
