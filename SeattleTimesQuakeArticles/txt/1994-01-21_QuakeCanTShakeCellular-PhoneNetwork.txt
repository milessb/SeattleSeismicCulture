Conventional phone lines may have jammed in Los Angeles after Monday's quake, but McCaw Cellular's wireless network stayed up and running.     AT&T phone lines in L.A. maxed out Monday with 204.7 million call attempts, eclipsing the Nov. 29 record of 191.1 million (the first business day after Thanksgiving is typically busy). Incoming calls jumped to 60 percent over normal.     AT&T asked callers to limit call duration and use a single outside contact to notify other family members and friends. Pacific Bell blocked long-distance calls so emergency services and local callers could get through.     But McCaw's Cellular One network was relatively unscathed by the quake. Only two of more than 400 cell sites were knocked out. Except for peak periods when use exceeded capacity, wireless phone users experienced little loss of service.     Cell transmitters are  on earthquake-resistant poles or fixtures. Auxiliary fuel-powered generators supply electricity if power goes down.      For the most part, the system worked, with only a handful of the cell-site generators running out of fuel when service personnel were unable to reach them.     The Kirkland-based cellular provider, which donates millions of dollars annually to relief efforts as a way of introducing people to wireless technology, helped set up eight Red Cross calling centers where quake victims could call free to anyone in the world. The company supplied 3,000 phones to the centers.     Phones also were provided to the Office of Emergency Services, California Transit, American Red Cross, FEMA and the California Highway Patrol.
