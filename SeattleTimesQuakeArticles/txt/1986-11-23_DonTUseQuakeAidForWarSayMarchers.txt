SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ Thousands of people marched yesterday through areas of the capital hit by last month's powerful earthquake to demand that foreign aid sent to help disaster victims not be used to finance the nation's civil war        The protesters, organized by the National Salvadoran Workers Union, walked through the main downtown streets and neighborhoods in the southern part of the city shouting their demands through megaphones.        Union leaders claimed 50,000 people took part, but diplomats watching the march put the number at 7,000.        The protesters also demanded salary increases for peasants who pick coffee and cotton and cut sugar cane, the country's three main exports.        The march ended at the presidential offices, where union leaders met with 170 people from various U.S. cities who were in San Salvador to deliver aid for earthquake victims.        About 1,500 people died in the Oct. 10 earthquake, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Damage was estimated at $2 billion.        The leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front have been fighting for seven years to overthrow the U.S.-backed government in El Salvador. About 62,000 people, many of them civilians, have been killed in the war.
