LOS ANGELES - In the aftermath of last month's earthquake, thousands of police officers, sheriff's deputies and National Guard troops helped keep criminals off the streets, according to internal police records    Day-by-day records gathered by the Los Angeles Police Department show that so-called repressible crime - those crimes that experts say can be deterred by uniformed police officers - dropped by 21.5 percent during the second half of January, after the Jan. 17 earthquake.      The biggest drops were recorded in the San Fernando Valley. In Southwest Los Angeles, a community that saw some of the worst rioting in 1992, repressible crime was down 14.6 percent during the last two weeks in January.
