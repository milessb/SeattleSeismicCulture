SAN FRANCISCO - State Bar examiners decided not to grade the afternoon session of the bar exam taken Feb. 28 in fairness to Southern California applicants who were forced out of the test center by an earthquake        The quake, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, forced about 800 law students to evacuate two buildings at the Pomona fairgrounds test site.        The would-be lawyers had about one hour and 15 minutes left in testing time when the quake struck. It caused minor damage and injuries in the region.        An estimated 4,100 California applicants took the Multistate Bar Examination last month, about 2,800 of them in Southern California.        The Committee of Bar Examiners decided in emergency session it would be unfair to grade the afternoon session for any of the applicants.        They said they will score each applicant based on the morning session and then use a national sample of those who took the Multistate to come up with an overall score.
