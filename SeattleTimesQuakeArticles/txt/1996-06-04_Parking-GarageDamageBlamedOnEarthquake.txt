BELLEVUE - Last month's 5.4-magnitude earthquake apparently caused the collapse of a piece of the Bellevue Square parking garage Friday afternoon.     George Wrede, an architect and vice president of the mall owner, Kemper Development Co., said today the cause of the collapse "probably was a little crack of some sort in there and the earthquake loosened it."      No one was injured, but a car was slightly damaged when a portion of the outside wall pulled away from the fourth floor of the garage. Part of the fourth-floor concrete, still attached to steel reinforcing bars, then sagged  downward, said Bellevue Square spokeswoman Jennifer Leavitt.     Leavitt said the shopping center reopened for business Saturday morning while structural engineers assessed the garage and took X-rays of the structure. About 80 parking spots were lost in the collapse of the northwest edge of a garage on the northeast portion of the Bellevue Square property.     That part of the garage was built in 1985. The shopping center is celebrating its 50th anniversary this summer, although the original, much smaller mall was at a different location.
