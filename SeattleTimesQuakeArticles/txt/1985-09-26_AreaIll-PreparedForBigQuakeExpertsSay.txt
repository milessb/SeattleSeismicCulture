Washington is due for an earthquake and federal and local officials fear there will be numerous deaths and injuries because residents are ill prepared for such a disaster, emergency services officials say         An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale has hit Washington about every 20 years. The last such quake, which can cause major damage, hit Washington in 1965, University of Washington seismologist Linda Nosen said at a news conference this morning.         ``We will have 6.5's and 7's in this area, but people are not ready,'' said Nosen.         Phil Cogan of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said people here are poorly prepared for such a disaster.          ``Apathy kills hundreds of people in earthquakes. We tend not to listen to warnings. Mexico helps us wake up in Washington State and prepare,'' he said.         Cogan cited a 1975 study which said up to 2,200 people could die if the Puget Sound area were hit by a 7.5 earthquake. The study also found that up to 23,000 people could be left homeless.         If a quake hits the state, Nosen said it most likely will be in the 6.5 range.
