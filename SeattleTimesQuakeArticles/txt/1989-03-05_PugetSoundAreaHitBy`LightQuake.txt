A light earthquake hit the region  late last night, shaking buildings in Seattle and causing chandeliers to swing in Issaquah.         No damage was reported.         Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist for the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Center in Golden, Colo., said the 10:42 p.m. earthquake registered 4.4 on the Richter scale. The center of the quake, which he called ``light,'' was Quilcene, south of Port Townsend on the Olympic Peninsula.         The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake of magnitude  4 can cause moderate damage.        But Presgrave said the jolt happened about 40 miles below the ground - much deeper than the earthquakes that plague parts of California. That depth, he said, widens the area affected and lessens the damage.         The earthquake center in Colorado received calls from Olympia, Port Angeles, Victoria, B.C., and Seattle.         Roseann Munson of Issaquah was sipping coffee and chatting with friends when the chandelier in her home began swinging. ``We all just stopped and said, `Wow!' ''         Maureen Sherman was resting in her Capitol Hill apartment when the bed started to shake.         ``The whole room was moving,'' she said. ``Things began to rustle around in the closet.'
