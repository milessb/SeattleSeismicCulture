HONG KONG - An earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale struck early today near the Solomon Islands, the Hong Kong Observatory reported.     The epicenter of the quake, recorded shortly after midnight Hong Kong time, was about 112 miles west-northwest of Honiara. There was no word of damage.     The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.     Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 times greater.
