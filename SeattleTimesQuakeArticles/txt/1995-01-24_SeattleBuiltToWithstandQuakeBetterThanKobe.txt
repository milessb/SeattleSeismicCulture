Seattle would probably suffer less damage and fewer casualties if hit by a magnitude 7.2 earthquake than was suffered by Kobe, Japan, engineers at the University of Washington said yesterday.     "This (Kobe) earthquake is not that much bigger than the Northridge earthquake" that struck Los Angeles one year ago, noted Gregory Mac                                                Rae, a bridge expert who spent three days in Kobe viewing the damage. "But the extent of the damage is much more than anything I've seen before."      American construction methods appear to perform better than traditional Japanese construction, said MacRae and engineering professors Steven Kramer, Marc Eberhard and John Stanton.     MacRae said Kobe's dense population and its location on tidewater landfills that liquefied during the earthquake contributed to the heavy damage.     A well-designed bridge that opened in April collapsed because the soils under it were so poor.     There are similar soils in the Pioneer Square and Kingdome area, the Duwamish industrial area and Harbor Island in Seattle, the engineers said, but most of Seattle's hills are much firmer.     Seattle's homes should also ride out a quake in better shape. American housing tends to be made of stud-wall construction, in which plywood panels lend lateral strength and nails provide both fastening power and some flexibility.     Traditional Japanese houses rely on a frame of a few large posts and beams with no bracing, topped by a heavy tile roof.     Those appear to have buckled easily.     The Japanese also have taken a different approach to earthquake safety in modern structures, the engineers said.     They have relied more on the massiveness of supports and less on making structures flexible and tied together with fastenings.     If there is a single structural lesson from the recent spate of earthquakes, the engineers said, it is the importance of fastening walls to roofs, posts to beams, and buildings to foundations.     Still, there were surprises in Kobe. Strong welds gave way, steel bridge decks expected to survive collapsed, and the widening of the tops of bridge posts - a tactic used on the Ballard Bridge to strengthen it - did not always work: Bridge beams slipped off the posts anyway.     "If there's a weak point in a structure, an earthquake will find it," MacRae said.     The engineers said we know how to make buildings earthquake-resistant, and those built to modern codes generally comply.     "If you gave me a blank check (to retrofit old structures), you'd get to the point where no buildings collapse," said Eberhard. "But obviously you never have that blank check. . . . I think we're on the right track. The question is how quickly do we want to do the retrofit?"      The city of Seattle and the state Department of Transportation have embarked on a program of earthquake improvements, but a lack of money and uncertainty about how soon a major quake might strike have made progress slow.     Eberhard and Stanton recently submitted recommendations to the state on improving the Alaskan Way Viaduct, but any real improvement may cost tens of millions of dollars, Eberhard said. Making the viaduct as safe as a modern bridge could cost as much as replacing it, the engineer warned.     San Francisco has removed its elevated Embarcadero Highway, which, like the viaduct, ran along the city's port area. Similarly, the elevated Nimitz Freeway, which collapsed in Oakland in the 1989 Bay Area earthquake, is being permanently rerouted.     But Eberhard argued drivers should not avoid the Alaskan Way Viaduct.     The chances of dying in a routine auto accident are far greater than being caught on an unsafe bridge in an earthquake, he said
