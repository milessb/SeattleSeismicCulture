A mild earthquake rattled north-central Washington yesterday, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.        The quake occurred at 2:57 a.m. and measured about 3.3 on the Richter scale of ground motion, although that figure could be revised after analysis, said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University of Washington's geophysics center.        Preliminary analysis also showed the quake was centered in the relatively sparsely populated Stayman Flats area, a few miles south of Lake Chelan, she said.        The geophysics center received a call from a radio station in the area, which reported some listeners calling to report they had been shaken awake by the temblor, Jonientz-Trisler said.        ``It wouldn't be a known active fault'' that caused the quake, she said. ``I'm not sure what the older (geological) structure is there. In Eastern Washington these things happen sometimes in clusters.'' Small earthquakes that people don't even feel are common.
