ISLAMABAD, Pakistan â€” Nearly 400,000 people face a second winter without permanent shelter following last year's earthquake in the mountains and valleys of northern Pakistan, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said Tuesday. The 7.6 magnitude earthquake on Oct. 8, 2005, killed more than 73,000 people in Pakistan and 1,500 in Indian Kashmir, and rendered more than 3 million destitute. "One year after, it is estimated that around 66,000 families are still without permanent shelter, while recent landslides and flooding have also left many quake survivors in a precarious position," the federation said in a statement. Aid agencies reckon that the average family in Pakistani Kashmir and North West Frontier Province has around six members. Before last winter, relief agencies had feared a second wave of deaths from cold and sickness among survivors living in makeshift shelters and unsanitary camps, but the weather was mercifully mild. Relief agencies fear the winter won't be as kind for a second year running. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and their local affiliate are planning to run support activities for a million people until at least 2008, but need more funds.
