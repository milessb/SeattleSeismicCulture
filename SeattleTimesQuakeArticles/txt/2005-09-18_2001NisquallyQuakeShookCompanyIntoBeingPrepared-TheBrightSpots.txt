Managers at The Seattle Chocolate Co. saved a couple of bricks from the company’s old headquarters to remind them what an earthquake can do. The 2001 Nisqually quake ripped apart the unreinforced Sodo building where the confectioner turned out truffles and chocolate meltaways. No workers were injured in the magnitude 6.8 quake, but it took seven weeks and cost $700,000 to relocate and resume production. Already struggling financially — and with no earthquake insurance — the company’s prospects seemed sticky as a bonbon left in the sun. Today, Seattle Chocolates is expanding so fast that communications manager Ellen Gengler admits some of the new bookcases and office furniture haven’t yet been secured to prevent them from toppling in a quake. But everything in the production room is bolted down at the company’s new South Park location. The building is reinforced concrete, not brick. Employees are drilled in earthquake safety, and computer records are copied every day and stored off-site. Expanding sales, which include a contract to make Frango mints for Macy’s, led managers to open a new distribution center in Iowa. The facility will also provide crucial backup in case another Seattle disaster disrupts the flow of chocolates to customers around the country. "Since Nisqually, it has been on the top of our minds — how are we going to prepare for another earthquake," Gengler said. The company’s single-most-important preparation? "One word," Gengler said. "Insurance."
