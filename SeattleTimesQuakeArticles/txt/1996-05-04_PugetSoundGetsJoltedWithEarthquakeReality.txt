THURSDAY night's exciting but benign temblor was another reminder that seismic activity is a fact of life in the Pacific Northwest.     Earthquakes happen here; they are not a novelty. Our natural legacy - and the certainty of a major jolt in our future - carries with it a personal and civic responsibility to prepare for the consequences.     Scientists are intrigued that the 5.3 quake was centered around Duvall, northeast of Seattle in the Cascade foothills. They were hardly surprised to find faults in an area that created mountains, but the location did not fit their conceptual models. For the experts, the data gap reinforced the notion that the region is rich with potential quake sites that are not well-understood or documented.     That should change with a new U.S. Geological Service aerial survey of earth-magnetic changes, which peers through thousands of years of glacial debris to paint a better picture of the earth's crust. The USGS is also teaming with the federal Emergency Management Agency to develop software local governments can use to estimate earthquake losses and better target public investments that reduce seismic hazards and risks.     For all the earthquake notoriety that hung like black crepe on the Kingdome, the concrete marvel rode out the quake just as if someone had planned it that way. The crowd handled the excitement better than some of the pencil-pushers in the media. The Dome will get plenty of expensive attention, don't worry.     A better question for all of us is how have we handled things around home, or on the job. A guide to earthquake preparedness reprinted in yesterday's Times is especially handy for household planning.     In less than 18 months, this region has had two stout warning shots across the bow of the commonweal: last Thursday and January 1995.     Don't worry about the Kingdome. How steady is that bookshelf at home, or the computer at work? Both the hazards and fixes are part of our daily life.
