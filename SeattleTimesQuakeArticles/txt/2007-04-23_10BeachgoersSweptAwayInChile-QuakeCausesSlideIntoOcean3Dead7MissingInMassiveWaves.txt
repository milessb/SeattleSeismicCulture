SANTIAGO, Chile â€” An earthquake in remote southern Chile shook free a landslide of rocks, sending them smashing into a narrow fjord and causing massive 25-foot waves that swept away 10 beachgoers. Three bodies were recovered Sunday. Rescuers were searching the cold Pacific waters for the other missing people from the beach after the 6.2-magnitude quake the day before, authorities said. The government's Emergency Bureau said three bodies were found washed up on beaches in the fjord Sunday. The victims were identified as Ernesto Contreras, 65; his wife, Elsa Poblete, 54; and their 2-year-old grandson Genaro Linay, the agency said. The bureau said there was no tsunami after the earthquake. The waves apparently were created when several landslides from neighboring hills crashed into the sea at the bottom of the narrow fjord, causing the water level to rise steeply, said Juan Cayupi, a volcanologist investigating the incident for the government. Meanwhile, President Michele Bachelet arrived Sunday and was met by protests from angry residents who say the government has been slow to offer assistance after several months of seismic activity in the region. After touring the area, Bachelet said the government would reinforce the region's health services with more doctors and ambulances, as well as a helicopter and a power generator in case of a new emergency. The quake was centered about 35 miles northwest of the city of Coihaique, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. There was no major damage to buildings.
