MEXICO CITY _ Survivors of the two killer earthquakes buried their dead and continued rescue efforts, but hope of finding many more alive ebbed as the hours passed.        Mayor Ramon Aguirre's office said last night that 1,952 people were known to have died in the quakes that jolted central Mexico last Thursday and Friday with intensities of 7.8 and 7.3 on the Richter scale. Spokesman Humberto Romero said the number of missing is estimated at 2,000, many of whom are believed entombed under collapsed buildings.        Six thousand people were injured.        Teams of dogs from Switzerland and the United States were being used to find survivors.        Aguirre has said more than 400 buildings were destroyed or damaged There were unconfirmed reports that officials planned to raze hundreds of structures feared near collapse or believed to contain decaying bodies that might trigger an epidemic.        Rescue workers, most of them volunteers, gouged their way through rubble to reclaim bodies and hunt for those who survived.        Vaccination clinics have been set up to immunize people against the possibility of disease. Red Cross officials said 5,000 people in the heavily damaged Tlatelolco area alone had been inoculated against typhoid and tetanus since Saturday.        Thousands, many wearing masks to filter out the smell of death and possible disease, filed slowly past decomposing bodies packed in dry ice, looking for friends and relatives.        Health authorities, citing the increasing risk of epidemics, are pressuring the government to bury the decaying bodies But resistance in this deeply Roman Catholic society to the idea of interring the dead without proper ceremony or the presence of family is strong.        With the final death toll expected by many to approach 10,000, Mexico City's cemeteries are quickly becoming saturated, adding to strains on families and officials forced to seek burial space far outside the capital.
