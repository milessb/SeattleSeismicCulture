BEIJING  - A strong earthquake struck a centuries-old trading center along the Silk Road in remote northwestern China last night, killing at least 24 people, collapsing 50,000 buildings and cracking a dike    More than 78 people were injured in the 6.9-magnitude quake, government seismologists said today.    The number of dead, injured and homeless was expected to rise when communications were restored to some of the hardest-hit areas near the epicenter of the quake, 35 miles northeast of the city of Kashgar in the Xinjiang region.    Fifty-two aftershocks were recorded, including one with a magnitude of 5.1, said Zhang Yunfeng with the Xinjiang Seismology Bureau.    About 10,000 people were homeless after the quake damaged or destroyed their homes, Zhang said.     Temperatures in the sparsely populated desert region with low-lying mountains were around freezing today and were expected to drop to 14 degrees overnight.   Cracks as wide as 19 1/2 inches opened up along a 2,000-foot section of a dike at a small reservoir. Water was leaking out and residents worked through the night to close the gaps, Zhang said.    Artux, a small trading town of 30,000, is inhabited mainly by ethnic Kyrgyz. Most live in mud-brick homes with wood beam roofs covered with mud that could cause heavy casualties if they collapsed.    The remote area, near China's border with the former Soviet republics of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, is a vibrant commercial crossroads along the old Silk Road that once connected East to West. Many of its inhabitants are Muslim ethnic minorities, including Uygurs and Tajiks.    Yesterday's quake followed a 6.1 magnitude quake along the Mongolian border last week and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake in southwestern Yunnan province on Feb. 3, which killed more than 300 people.Caption:  MAPAP: EARTHQUAKE IN CHINA (MAP NOT AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY)
