BRYANT, Snohomish County — A magnitude 3.7 earthquake shook the ground north of Seattle early Thursday. The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake at 1:42 a.m. was about 8 miles northeast of Bryant.  Forty-five people in Arlington, about 10 miles from the quake’s epicenter, reported on the USGS website that they felt it.  Julie Dutton with the National Earthquake Information Center says it’s unlikely that the quake was related to a series of small temblors that have been shaking California in recent days.  There were no reports of damage or injuries.
