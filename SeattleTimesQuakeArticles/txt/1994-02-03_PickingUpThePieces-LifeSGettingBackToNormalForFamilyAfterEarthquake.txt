A big and belated thank you for such a well-done story ("Pick it up, dust it off," The Times, Jan. 19, by Eric Pryne). Mr. Pryne's accuracy and attention to detail was phenomenal. His courtesy, and that of your photographer, Barry Wong, was beyond reproach. Friends had warned us that sensationalism might take a front seat, but not in our case      Our lives are slowly getting back to "normal," yet Justin, our 13-year-old, still insists on sleeping in our room in his sleeping bag.     Jason, our 18-year-old, seems to be suffering from withdrawal symptoms since his room is virtually clean and empty now. But rest assured, it won't be long. I've noticed his pockets bulging as he leaps up the stairs to his room, his enthusiasm growing daily. And life goes on! Arline Kaltenbach Granada Hills, Calif.
