YEREVAN, U.S.S.R. - People in cities shattered by the Dec. 7 earthquake flung themselves before bulldozers to keep workers from clearing rubble until bodies of relatives were found, Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov said yesterday        Tanks and armored personnel carriers sealed off Spitak, one of the devastated Armenian cities. At least 10 bulldozers cleared debris and trucks hauled it away, said Morten Horvaal, a news photographer who drove past Spitak twice yesterday.        The head of the Communist Party in Spitak, 46 miles northwest of Yerevan, said Thursday that demolition would begin tomorrow.         Ryzhkov did not give details of the disruption by residents, mentioned during a televised report of a meeting of the Politburo commission overseeing rescue and relief operations.        He said one more survivor was pulled from the ruins Thursday in Spitak, where the quake killed about 15,000 of the 25,000 residents, and that 20 people had been found alive in Leninakan. Officials estimate the overall death toll at 55,000.        The head of the Soviet Red Cross said Soviet doctors can handle the treatment of earthquake victims and do not need international help.        Several foreign doctors complained privately that Soviet colleagues would not let them treat patients with the millions of dollars' worth of sophisticated medical equipment brought in especially for the disaster.        Dr. Dmitri Venidiktov, chairman of the Soviet Red Cross and former deputy health minister, said at a news conference in Yerevan, capital of the Armenian republic: ``If we talk about (foreign) doctors and nurses, I can say thank you very much, but it's no longer necessary, ''        He said medical teams had arrived from throughout the Soviet Union, and ``we can accept individuals (from abroad) to show them what has been done, but we don't need medical assistance in the direct sense.''        Ryzhkov praised foreign volunteers and said the Foreign Ministry had not given them enough assistance.        ``They helped in a big way,'' the premier said, even though ``you can't even find translators here.''        Some foreign doctors said they were leaving earlier than planned, but others were on the way to the stricken region.        Thirty-five Israeli doctors and health-care workers had been expected yesterday, but fog at the small Yerevan airport prevented their arrival. More than 100 international flights have landed at Yerevan since the quake.        George Reid, spokesman for the international League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said 22,312 bodies were recovered by yesterday, an increase of 537 from the previous day. Reid said the projected death toll was 45,000.        Soviet officials say the quake claimed 55,000 lives and left 500,000 of the 700,000 people in the area homeless.        Dr. Robert Gale, an American who helped the Soviets during the Chernobyl nuclear disaster more than two years ago, said he believed 100,000 people had been killed, based on personal observation.        Reid said 5,079 injured remained hospitalized and 4,440 had been discharged. ``The Red Cross is feeding 500,000 people in Ethiopia, and we had years to prepare,'' he said. ``That's about the number affected here in 20 seconds.''        The Red Cross is bringing in 5,000 winter tents, he said, and Soviet authorities are hoping to bring in thousands of yurts, modern versions of Mongol tents, by rail.        Soviet officials also hope to bring in mobile homes, Reid said, adding that 5,000 are needed in Spitak alone to shelter local men who will work on rebuilding the town.        Eduard Aikazyan, the Armenian government representative in Moscow, said the rebuilding of ruined cities and towns would not begin until rescue efforts were finished, but he did not say when that would be.        He said each survivor would be given 500 rubles and families would get 2,000 rubles in addition to the individual allowances.        Aikazyan said evacuation of women and children to sanatoriums and vacation resorts would continue.        Those who want to remain near their homes will be allowed to do so, he said.
