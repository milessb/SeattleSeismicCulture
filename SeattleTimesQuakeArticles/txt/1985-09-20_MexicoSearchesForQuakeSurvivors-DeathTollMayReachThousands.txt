MEXICO CITY _ Fires flared across this devastated city today, and desperate rescue teams clambered over the ruins as the hemisphere's greatest metropolis dug out of one of its greatest tragedies, a giant earthquake that tore at the midsection of the Americas        Officials and witnesses confirmed at least 230 dead in the quake yesterday morning, but the toll is expected to go into the thousands. Mexico's Channel 2 television, in a report that was not attributed, said 770 people were confirmed killed.        A grim-faced Mayor Ramon Aguirre said an estimated 1,000 people were entombed in collapsed buildings in this teeming city of 17 million. At least 5,000 people have been treated for injuries, he said.        Mexico City and four coastal states, Colima, Guerrero, Jalisco and Michoacan, were hardest hit by the 7:18 a.m. quake, which leveled cathedrals, schools, hospitals, hotels and scores of other buildings _ at least 250 buildings in Mexico City alone, according to Aguirre.        The temblor lasted three minutes _ an eon in the seismic world _ and measured 7.8 on the Richter scale of ground motion, making it the strongest to rock Mexico since 1973.        Between 110 and 150 people were killed in Jalisco state, 500 miles northwest of here, and about 1,500 injured. In Michoacan state, 30 people were reported killed when two hotels collapsed at the beach resort of Playa Azul. In the resort of Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo in Guerrero state, five hotels were damaged and the resident of a private dwelling was reported killed.    Mexican and Salvadoran navy vessels reported five merchant ships and four trawlers missing in the Pacific 135 miles west of Acapulco.        President Reagan has sent a message to President Miguel de la Madrid offering full U.S. assistance. De la Madrid declared a state of emergency and appealed for calm.        Had the quake occurred half an hour later than it did, many thousands of downtown Mexico City office workers would certainly have died. The number of office blocks that completely collapsed was in the dozens.        Many tall buildings collapsed like piles of cards, while others leaned precariously to one side, leaving their future in doubt. The city's famed central boulevard, the 10-lane wide Paseo de la Reforma, was mong the worst-hit areas, and the corner of Reforma and the Avenida Insurgentes _ said to be the most vehicle-polluted intersection in the world _ looked like a scene from a World War II bombing raid.        The Continental Hilton Hotel, on that corner, collapsed from the top for three stories, but the casualty toll was not clear as rescue workers continued burrowing into the rubble.        Until a few years ago, passers-by could see a large, poorly disguised vertical crack in the hotel's facade, a memento from the 1957 quake.        On another corner of the huge Reforma-Insurgentes junction, giant three-yard square plates of glass had plummeted from the modernistic Nacional Financiera bank building, crushing a row of parked cars.        In another section of the city, the Judicial Police building crumbled to the ground, killing or trapping scores or possibly hundreds of policemen and other workers in the rubble.        A full wing of the city's general hospital collapsed in a heap, but it was not immediately known how many doctors or patients were trapped or killed.        Several school buildings also collapsed. At least one of them, on the Avenida Frey Servando Teresa de Mier, was known to have pupils inside. But in most of the schools, children had not yet arrived.         Some 10,000 soldiers in combat gear, who had paraded down Reforma in spotless uniforms three days earlier to mark Mexico's independence from Spain in the early 19th century, were back again today.        This time, their uniforms covered in dust, they dispersed along side streets to detour drivers, keep people away from buildings still in danger of collapse, and to prevent looting.         One of the oddest things about yesterday's quake was that it hit only a relatively localized area of the capital _ about 12 square miles _ and although it was felt elsewhere, caused little damage in most of the sprawling city's 931 square miles.        A few hundred yards from the Reforma, for instance, life went on almost as normal throughout the day with beggars and chewing-gum vendors bothering motorists on a hot, sunny September morning.        But scenes like that were islands of unreality. Most of the city was chaos. Thousands of residents spent the night outside because they had no homes to return to or feared buildings still standing might collapse. Temporary shelters were set up in offices and public buildings.        Bulldozers and cranes removed mountains of broken concrete, bricks and glass, and 50,000 workers took part in cleanup and rescue operations. Hour by hour, more bodies are being pulled out.        Gas and power lines snapped by the quake touched off dozens of fires last night. Some of them still burned today. Half the capital was blacked out overnight, but power was gradually restored this morning, along with some telephone service. Officials warned that water supplies would be irregular for at least three days.        Scores of patients were buried under debris when the three-story Juarez Hospital, near the central Plaza de la Revolucion, collapsed. The massive monument at the center of the plaza suffered extenside damage.        The Colonia Roma, a residential district near odowntown replete with homes built at the turn of the century, was cordoned off because of gas leaks. Radio announcements urged residents not to light matches, smoke or switch on electrical appliances.        Subways in the city's Metro system, which carries 4.5 million people a day, screeched to a halt when the quake struck.Caption:  PHOTO MAPED WALKER / SEATTLE TIMES: MAP OF MEXICO AND THE EARTHQUAKE EPICENTER.AP: RESCUE WORKERS TAKE A QUAKE VICTIM FROM A DESTROYED BUILDING IN MEXICO CITY.AP: RESCUE WORKERS TAKE A QUAKE VICTIM FROM A DESTROYED BUILDING IN MEXICO CITY
