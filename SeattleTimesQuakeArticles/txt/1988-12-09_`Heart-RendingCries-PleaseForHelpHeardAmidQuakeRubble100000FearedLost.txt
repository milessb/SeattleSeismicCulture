Foreign countries sent planes loaded with emergency supplies into Armenia today to help the Soviets assist victims of an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people and left hundreds of thousands homeless        A spokesman for Yerevan's Zvarnots Airport said planes arrived today from France, Belgium and Bulgaria and many more from around the world were expected. It was the first time foreign aid had reached the Soviet Union on such a scale.        Officials released no death toll for Wednesday's quake, but official media revised casualty estimates upward in the southern republic of 3.3 million.        Tass news agency said, ``The earthquake killed tens of thousands of people.'' Radio Moscow said, ``It is believed that scores of thousands of people have died.''        Previous statements had put the death toll in the thousands, but sources have provided unofficial estimates of as many as 50,000.        Tass said the quake left 400,000 people homeless.            When asked if the fatality figure could reach 100,000, Rudolph Khochanov, an Armenian Foreign Ministry representative in Moscow, said, ``It is possible.'' The dead ``could be 50,000, 70,000 or even 100,000,'' he said.        A scientist predicted more tremors would occur. Workers scrambled to find survivors buried in the rubble.        President Mikhail Gorbachev returned home from the United States to direct the growing relief efforts, which brought emergency food, medics, medical supplies and search equipment to the devastated region.        Gorbachev, who cut short a trip to New York and canceled plans to visit Cuba and Britain, arrived in Moscow before dawn, Tass said. He was expected to travel to the stricken area, but officials refused to say when he would do so.        Leon Azruyan, an editor at the official Armenpress news agency in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, said he saw dozens of villages destroyed. In Spitak, a city of 16,000 near Leninakan, ``99 percent of the population is gone,'' he said.        ``Helpless, sobbing people are climbing on the wreckage of an apartment house, from which can be heard heart-rending cries for help,'' the Communist Party daily Pravda wrote from Leninakan, a heavily battered city near the quake's epicenter.        Tass quoted him as saying the tremors ``should be less powerful'' than the quake, which also rocked portions of the republics of Azerbaijan and Georgia.        Official Soviet media covered the disaster with unprecedented scope and speed.        In an interview yesterday on Soviet television, Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov appealed for aid to the    area. He said rescue workers needed cranes and other heavy equipment to remove debris and look for survivors.        TV reports said two-thirds of Leninakan, a city of 290,000 on the Turkish border, was destroyed.        Spitak ``was practically erased from the face of the Earth,'' said one television correspondent.        Tass said half the buildings in Kirovakan, a city of 150,000, had crumbled.        It said the injured and those left homeless were being housed in tents, military barracks, officers' houses and clubs, garrisons and dining rooms.        Alexei Gartinsky, a senior official of the Soviet Red Cross, told ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' today that antibiotics, disposable syringes and blood supplies were needed.        Albert Khachatryan, a department head of the Armenia Health Ministry, said by telephone that 4,700 injured people, including 800 children, were in Yerevan's hospitals.        ``We have set up special surgical and trauma units in various hospitals and more than 300 specialists from other cities and other republics have arrived to help out,'' he said.        President Reagan offered humanitarian aid, Cuban President Fidel Castro pledged to send construction workers and Britain dispatched London firefighters to join the rescue effort.        Switzerland sent specially trained search dogs to sniff for survivors, France sent a rescue team involved in the 1985 quake in Mexico City, Italy dispatched a 19-member rescue team and the Swedish Red Cross said it would send $333,000 worth of medical supplies.        Gov. Steve Cowper of Alaska offered to send teams of trained dogs and searchers to help find trapped survivors.        The Alaska National Guard was ready on short notice to fly the three dogs and their handlers, which most frequently are used in wilderness searches for lost hunters and hikers.         The Armenpress news agency also said rioters in the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan had set fire to nine Armenian houses in the capital, Baku, after troops were redeployed to help the earthquake rescue operation.         Armenpress said five planeloads of refugees from Baku had arrived in Yerevan yesterday with reports of continuing ethnic violence.         At least 31 people have died in two weeks of clashes in Armenia and Azerbaijan. The violence was the latest flare-up in 10 months of unrest over the disputed Azerbaijani territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.         The spokesman quoted the Armenians arriving from Baku as saying the nine houses belonging to Armenians had been set on fire.         In Baku, a spokesman for the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry quoted the city's military commander as saying there had been some ``illegal actions.''    --  Compiled from Associated Press, United Press International and Reuters.Caption:  PHOTOUPI / TASS: WOMEN IN LENINAKAN, ARMENIA, GRIEVE FOR RELATIVES LOST IN THE MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE THAT HIT THE AREA WEDNESDAY.UPI / TASS: A CAR LIES BURIED UNDER RUBBLE IN LENINAKAN.
