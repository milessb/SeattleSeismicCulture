LOS ANGELES    Jill Zalben says her gift baskets make a lovely Mother's Day gift, nicely wrapped in cellophane and full of things mom would want: a flashlight, purified drinking water and antibiotic ointment    Even mothers, Zalben says, should be prepared for an earthquake.    The Earthquake-Disaster Gift Basket was among thousands of quake-related items available at sales booths at the Earthquake Preparedness Show over the weekend.    A growing number of entrepreneurs have found profit in quake preparedness as they cater to public nervousness in an increasingly shaky California after last year's devastating San Francisco quake.
