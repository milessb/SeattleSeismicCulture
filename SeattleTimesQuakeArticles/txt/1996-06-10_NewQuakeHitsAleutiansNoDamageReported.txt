ANCHORAGE - An earthquake of magnitude 7.2 rattled the Aleutian Islands today, one day after a stronger tremor sent hundreds of people rushing to high ground because of the threat of high waves.    No damage or injuries were reported from today's quake.    And the highest wave caused by yesterday's 7.7 shaker was only about 3 feet above normal tides at the Aleutian island of Adak, closest island to the quake's epicenter, said a spokesman for the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center.    The epicenter of today's quake was in the Pacific about 30 miles southwest of Adak.     That was the third major quake in the Aleutians in the past two days; a temblor measuring 6.3 was recorded Saturday 65 miles southwest of Adak.    Yesterday's 8:04 p.m. quake was centered about 60 miles west-southwest of Adak     "Everything was shaking, the power went out, bookshelves fell over, all the drawers on desks and filing cabinets are open. My tool box wandered across the floor," said Adak resident Steve Bell.
