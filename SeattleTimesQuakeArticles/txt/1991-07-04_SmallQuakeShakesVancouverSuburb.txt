MAPLE RIDGE, B.C.      A minor earthquake lasting a few seconds rattled some residents of the suburbs east of Vancouver yesterday but didn't cause any damage, a seismologist reported.      The tremor measured 3.2 on the Richter scale, and the quake was felt most strongly in the Maple Ridge area, about 30 miles east of Vancouver, said Robert Horner of the Pacific Geoscience Centre in Sidney.
