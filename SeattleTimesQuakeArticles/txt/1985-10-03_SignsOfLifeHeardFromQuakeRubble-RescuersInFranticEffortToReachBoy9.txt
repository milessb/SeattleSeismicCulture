MEXICO CITY _ Rescuers this morning again heard signals from a 9-year-old boy who has been buried alive for more than two weeks under 20 tons of rubble from a devastating earthquake.         ``Someone's alive, someone is definitely alive down there,'' a rescue worker said today after probing deep into the rubble with sonar equipment. ``We heard him knocking back.''        The workers called for nearly an hour of silence at the site this morning so sound equipment could pick up signals from inside.        Rescuers said they were picking up signs of life from only one person, although relatives said the boy was with his grandfather when the quake struck Sept. 19.        Since his distant signals were first heard Sunday, progress reaching the boy has been very slow. Rescuers say they must take a circuitous route to reach the child because of the way a wall had fallen around him.            The child signaled to rescue workers yesterday that he was pinned down on his back but could wiggle his arms and legs.        The boy's tapping was faint because ``it is difficult for him to raise his hand,'' said Dr. Enrique Camacho Romero, a veterinarian in charge of one rescue team. Workers and doctors who visited the site said it appeared the child, Luis Ramon Mazerati, was too weak to talk.        A relief worker, Sergio Andreas Fernandez, said two parallel tunnels had been dug and the boy was thought to be between them. A Red Cross worker said earlier yesterday that the operation was complicated because the floor had caved in around the boy.        Rescue crews raced to slash through mesh wire in the concrete with an acetylene torch as dogs pawed and sniffed the rubble.Caption:  PHOTOAP: SONIA MARIBEL MALDONADO WAITS BEHIND A POLICE LINE FOR NEWS OF HER SON, LUIS, AS RESCUERS TRY TO FREE HIM FROM THE RUBBLE OF A MEXICO CITY APARTMENT BUILDING.
