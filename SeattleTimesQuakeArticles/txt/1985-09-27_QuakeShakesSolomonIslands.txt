SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A strong earthquake shook the Solomon Islands today, but initial reports indicated there were no injuries or serious damage.        ``People panicked and rushed into the streets,'' said Julian Makaa, a producer at the state-owned Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corp.          The U.S. Geological Survey reported that the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 on the Richter scale. Its epicenter was about 1,300 miles northeast of Brisbane, Australia, said spokesman Don Finley.        A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage.
