LOS ANGELES - A strong earthquake rocked Southern California today, killing one person and damaging buildings and homes in suburbs east of Los Angeles. Sporadic electrical outages and aftershocks occurred     The 7:43 a.m. quake was estimated at 6.0 on the Richter scale by the California Institute of Technology. The epicenter was 8 miles north of suburban Sierra Madre, beneath the rugged San Gabriel Mountains.     A woman worker at Santa Anita racetrack in Arcadia, just south of Sierra Madre, was reportedly killed by a falling steel beam.     Damage was reported to the historic Pasadena Playhouse, where a 40-foot by 5-foot chunk of its rear wall fell off and damaged part of a neighboring building, and to the Pasadena City Hall.     "It was quite a jolt, I'll tell you," said Pasadena City Clerk Marvell Herren. "We have broken glass and some cracks in the walls."     Highrises swayed in downtown Los Angeles and the temblor was felt 100 miles northwest in Santa Barbara and Kern counties, and south to the Mexican border.     The greatest damage appeared confined to the San Gabriel Mountain foothill communities 10 to 20 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. The mountain range lies north and east of the Los Angeles basin.     Store windows crashed down in Pasadena and part of the facade of a four-story brick apartment building fell onto Colorado Boulevard. Police roped off the building. There did not appear to be injuries there.     Damage regionwide seemed amazingly light for a quake of its magnitude.     "I've got reports of scattered light damage," said Jim Goltz of the state Office of Emergency Services.     If the preliminary Richter reading is not revised, the quake will be ranked as the strongest in Southern California since the Superstition Hills earthquakes of Nov. 23 and 24, 1987. They measured 6.2 and 6.6 on the Richter scale.
