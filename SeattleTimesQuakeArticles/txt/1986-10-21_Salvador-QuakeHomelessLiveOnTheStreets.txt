SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ Tens of thousands of Salvadorans who lost their homes in the recent earthquake are living on streets and sidewalks throughout the capital, causing massive traffic jams and posing serious problems for authorities     On the Avenida Juan Pablo II, leading to the center of town, people have set up camps on the sidewalk and in one lane of the street.     ``Where else can we go? We have no other home,'' said one woman as she sat in the shade of her plastic-and-cardboard shack, cooking over an open wood fire.     Drinking and bathing water usually comes from broken water mains, increasing the risk of disease, but so far there have been no serious outbreaks. People stand in line in the hot sun for several hours to get what food rations are available. Small tremors and aftershocks continue to rumble though the battered city.     On the main road to the international airport, dozens of families have moved their tin shacks from the surrounding hill to the main street, cutting off two lanes of traffic and the sidewalk.     ``I know it's crazy, but here nothing will fall on us, and we have no land to move to,'' said a young man who was with his family on the hot pavement.     The lack of land is one of the most serious problems facing the government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte as it tries to rebuild from the quake that shattered the city Oct. 10. According to the government, the quake killed some 1,500 people, injured about 10,000 and left up to 200,000 homeless.
