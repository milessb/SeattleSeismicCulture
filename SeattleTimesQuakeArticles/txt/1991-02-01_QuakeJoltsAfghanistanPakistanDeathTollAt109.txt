ISLAMABAD, Pakistan  - At least 105 people were killed by a severe earthquake in northern Pakistan early today but the toll could be twice as high, Pakistani officials said.        In neighboring Afghanistan at least four people were killed by the quake, which also jolted parts of India and Soviet Central Asia, the official Kabul Radio said.        Pakistani officials said bodies of 105 people killed in the North West Frontier Province bordering Afghanistan had been spotted so far. But they said they feared the toll could be more than 200.        Hundreds of people were also injured and hundreds of houses collapsed or were damaged, they added.        They said the death toll from Pakistan's strongest quake in recent years was likely to rise as information was received from remote mountainous areas, some of which were snowbound.        The official Soviet news agency Tass said the quake rocked the central Asian republics of Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan, but reported no casualties. It said the quake caused landslides and destroyed communications, power transmission lines, roads and several residences in Tadjikistan.        Most of the damage in Pakistan was confined to the sparsely populated tribal area only miles from the Afghan border.        Among the worst affected were Afghan refugees living in squalid camps throughout the frontier region.        The quake, centered hundreds of miles away in neighboring Afghanistan, measured 6.8 on the Richter scale. The minute-long tremor at 4 a.m. struck many of the victims while they were asleep in fragile sun-baked mud huts.        The quake, which is considered severe, rattled windows in the capital of Islamabad for about a minute and sent frightened residents fleeing into the streets.
