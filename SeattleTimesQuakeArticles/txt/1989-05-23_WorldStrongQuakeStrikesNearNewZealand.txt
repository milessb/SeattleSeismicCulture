WASHINGTON         A severe earthquake struck the Macquarie Islands near New Zealand early today, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.         The quake was measured at 8.2 on the Richter scale, officials said.         It was the strongest temblor this year anywhere in the world, according to the survey.         The survey said it had no immediate reports of injuries.         A quake of 8 or more on the Richter scale is considered a ``great'' earthquake capable of tremendous damage. By comparison, the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 has been estimated at 8.3
