SKYKOMISH - A moderate earthquake with an epicenter six miles southeast of here shook the mountains of the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest early yesterday.  There were no reports of injuries or serious damage      The moderate quake had a depth of less than one mile. It was felt in Skykomish in King County, in the nearby Snohomish County towns of Monroe and Gold Bar, and as far away as Seattle, said Bill Steele, seismology lab coordinator at the University of Washington.    Two hours later, a quake with magnitude 2.5  struck about four miles west of North Bend.    The larger quake, with a 4.3 magnitude, occurred at 12:01 a.m. and was felt in the nearby communities of Gold Bar, Monroe and North Bend, the University of Washington geophysics program's seismology laboratory reported. There was a slight aftershock a few moments later.     Ballard resident David Darpinian said he and his wife, who were camping in the national forest's Alpine Lakes Wilderness, were awakened by the quake.    Yesterday morning's temblor was the second moderate quake to hit Western Washington in the past week. A 4.1 magnitude quake struck about 20 miles west of Bremerton last Wednesday.
