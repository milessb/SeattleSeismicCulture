PRINCE RUPERT, B.C.        An earthquake centered between the Queen Charlotte Islands and the British Columbia mainland struck yesterday, and residents reported seeing furniture move and rooms shake.        No damage or casualties were reported in the temblor, which was centered underwater in Dixon Entrance, 60 miles west of Prince Rupert on British Columbia's north coast.        Preliminary estimates from the Pacific Geoscience Center in Victoria set the tremor at about 5.0 on the Richter scale, geophysicist Gary Rogers said.        People in the Smithers and Terrace areas on the mainland and in Queen Charlotte City felt the quake and said rooms shook and furniture shifted.        One woman south of Terrace said, ``The house felt like it was going to fall right off its foundations. Everything was just sort of swaying. All the plants on the window were swaying.''        A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage.        The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
