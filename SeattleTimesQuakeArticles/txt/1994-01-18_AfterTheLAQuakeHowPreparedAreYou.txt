ALL across the region yesterday residents awoke to phones ringing with reports from friends and relatives in Los Angeles saying they had survived that city's terrifying early-morning earthquake.     By now, stunned reaction here has turned to the inevitable worries about our own personal and civic preparedness. Quakes of similar and greater magnitude than yesterday's in Los Angeles struck the Puget Sound region in 1949 and 1965, causing moderate but widespread damage and a total of 14 deaths.     Residents here can take specific action on two fronts to make themselves and their community safer.     There are many good reasons for Seattle voters to approve the $339 school bond issue on Feb. 8. But today, the best reason of all is safety. Some work already has been done to upgrade the structural integrity of the city's oldest schools. But much more is necessary to bring schools to full compliance with current codes. Many of the 22 individual projects to be financed by the bond issue include seismic work. The youngest of the schools to be fixed is 67 years old; the oldest has been around for 100 years.     At home, you don't have to wait to take action. If you haven't yet stockpiled food, water, flashlights, batteries and clothing in your car or an easily accessible area of your home, this is a good time to do so. Emergency planners recommend enough family supplies to last 72 hours.     Also, you should know the location of your water, gas and electric shut-offs and know how to turn them off. Keep necessary tools required to turn off utilities in a convenient place. Label gas and water main inlets and main electric circuit breaker for easy identification. If you have a chimney, repair any cracks or deteriorating mortar between bricks.     Once again, misfortune elsewhere serves as a warning and a reminder.
