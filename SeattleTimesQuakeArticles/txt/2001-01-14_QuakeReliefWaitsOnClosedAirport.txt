A U.S. aid agency said yesterday it would send plastic sheeting, medical kits, blankets and other supplies to earthquake victims in El Salvador as soon as an airport there reopened. "We have supplies prepared and ready to go in Miami, but we have to wait until an airport is open for us to land in," said Joseph Schultz, a spokesman for the U.S. Agency for International Development. The agency said it had three people in El Salvador and hoped to get five more emergency workers there by early today. The spokesman said he had no information on the powerful quake that shook the region yesterday because of downed telephone lines. The epicenter was about 65 miles southeast of the capital, San  Salvador.&nbsp;
