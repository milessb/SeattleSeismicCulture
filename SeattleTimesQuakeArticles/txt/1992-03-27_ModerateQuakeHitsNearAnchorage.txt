PALMER, Alaska A moderate earthquake rippled through towns north of Anchorage near midnight, a spokesman for the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said.    The quake, which measured 4.5 on the Richter scale, was strongly felt in Wasilla, about 40 miles northeast of Anchorage, and Talkeetna, about 90 miles north of the city, geophysicist Guy Urban said.    No injuries or damage were reported. The earthquake was powerful enough to shake parked cars and send hanging objects swinging, Urban said.     Also yesterday, a moderate earthquake centered about 130 miles west of Adak shook the Andreanof Islands in Alaska's Aleutian chain, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.     Earthquake monitors with the USGS in Golden, Colo., said their early seismograph readings indicated the tremor at a magnitude of 5.4 on the Richter scale.     The USGS said no immediate reports of damage were received. Earthquakes are common in the Aleutians.
