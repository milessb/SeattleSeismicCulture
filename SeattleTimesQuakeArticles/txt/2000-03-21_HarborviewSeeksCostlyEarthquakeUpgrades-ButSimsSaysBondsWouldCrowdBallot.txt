Two years after completing a $176 million expansion and renovation at Harborview Medical Center, its directors want $257 million to make sure other parts of the complex can withstand an earthquake.      King County officials say now is not the time to ask voters for lots of money.      Harborview officials say the region has little choice. Two wings of Harborview would not survive a moderate earthquake, putting in danger the county's ability to treat the many injuries expected in such a disaster.      "If a big one hits, we're in deep trouble," said David Jaffe, Harborview executive director. "The urgency and the timing are critical to the safety of the citizens in the entire county.  I would rather err on this year than next."       But finding the $257 million needed to demolish two buildings, put up two new ones and buttress another is not going to be easy, especially in a year already crowded with possible tax and bond elections.      Harborview officials hope to raise about $157 million for the eight-year project through county bond sales. An additional $45 million would come from the interest earned by investing the proceeds of those bonds, and the rest would be paid by Harborview from parking revenues and fees.      But King County Executive Ron Sims recommended that the county wait a year before holding an election for Harborview's bonds. Pat Steel, his budget director, said the hospital should use its reserves for some of the costs and continue  to look for state aid for the project. She said Sims also was concerned about crowding the November ballot with too many tax measures.      The county ballot might ask voters to continue a levy to pay for its computerized fingerprint database system, to raise the sales tax to help pay for transit costs after Initiative 695, and even to sell bonds to fix the county courthouse or build a new one. The present courthouse also would suffer heavy damage in an earthquake.      Sims' office is willing to consider a $102 million bond, Steel said.      Jaffe said the hospital's lobbyists tried to raise state money this past session, but the complications created by I-695, the measure that replaced the state vehicle-excise tax with a flat $30 fee, meant no solid commitment from the Legislature.          "Nothing would have pleased us more than to say we would like a $102 million bond, but our staff has been working for five months to bring the funds down and not compromise the integrity of our mission. And there are no other realistic numbers at this time."      Specifically, the seismic upgrade would involve taking down the East Wing Clinic and Harborview Hall, Jaffe said. In addition, Harborview's north wing, which houses half of the critical-care unit and does not meet earthquake-ready guidelines, would be upgraded, Jaffe said.      Activities in those two locations would be moved to other buildings. Meanwhile, two new facilities - with seismic upgrades - would be built on land adjacent to the present hospital campus. The sites of the old buildings would be used as open space. Construction would take approximately eight years.      The renovation Harborview finished in 1998 did not include the buildings in the present proposal. Tina Mankowski, spokeswoman for Harborview, said few people knew that those buildings were unsafe back in 1987, when voters approved the last bond issue.      It wasn't until 1992 that geologists discovered the Seattle Fault, which runs near the hospital. Studies in 1993 and 1994 showed that both buildings would not withstand an earthquake of 6.0 or higher on the Richter scale, even though they survived the 1964 earthquake of 6.5 with some serious damage.      The County Council needs to make a decision by mid-July to have the item on the fall ballot.      "Everyone would like to seismic upgrade, but it comes down to a question of cost and priorities," said Councilman Kent Pullen, R-Kent. "We need to ask if that money can be better spent in another way."      But Mankowski said, "Who knows when an earthquake is going to hit here. We need to move on this quickly."
