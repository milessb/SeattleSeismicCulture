In response to Burt Talcott's letter printed Oct. 27:         I am a little curious as to his allegations that the buildings and highways that suffered damage during the earthquake in San Francisco were due to greedy developers, shoddy work and faulty government inspection         This theory would logically conclude that all of the buildings and highways that did not fall down were built by altruistic developers.         A more accurate assessment would be that we need to examine, repair and upgrade all of the infrastructure in the United States.    - Ray Stahl, Port Angele
