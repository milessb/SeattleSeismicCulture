Tears still spring to the eyes of Redmond firefighter Lt. Rudy Alvarado when he talks about his week in Mexico City, helping set up a medical center with 20 other volunteers from Seattle and Bellevue         ``I'm tired but I want to go back,'' Alvarado said.         ``What affected me the most was leaving,'' said the 33-year-old firefighter and emergency medical technician. ``Being there didn't affect me, but to set up something like that and then to leave ... If only we could have stayed for another week and see the clinic established.         ``Besides, the people didn't want to see us leave,'' he said. ``We left part of ourselves down there.''         The Seattle area volunteers left for Mexico City on Sept. 26, a week after a massive earthquake devastated the town. Firefighters and doctors, nurses and paramedics from Harborview Medical Center went to work in an emergency medical unit in the Salvation Army center's church.         ``It was supposed to be like a MASH unit but what we found was very rough,'' Alvarado said. ``The first thing we did was organize what was there. They had all the drugs stacked in boxes and when they needed something, they would dig around in the boxes. We found some metal shelves and got everything set up.''         The proposal to send an emergency medical team to Mexico City came from Danny Gomez, a Seattle firefighter, who contacted Alvarado.         ``I think we were a well organized team, but the most important thing we had were people who cared,'' Alvarado said. ``There were a lot of teams that just went down there without contacting anyone and they would spin their wheels for a few days trying to find out what should be done.''         Once the volunteers set up their clinic, word quickly spread that ``the firefighters from Seattle'' were giving medical treatment, Alvarado said. More than 200 people a day started showing up. Some had been injured in the quake, and many were suffering from shock.         In one case, ``a mother came in with her little girls and said they wouldn't eat or sleep. They all had high-blood pressure,'' Alvarado said. ``There was nothing physically wrong with them. It was all mental. The mother told me a daughter had asked her a question and she slapped her. The mother kept saying, `I made her bleed. I made her bleed.'''         The woman's husband was in the hospital and their home was wrecked by the quake, but the family was still living there. Alvarado said there was a lot of pressure on the mother to find money to support the family. He explained this to the little girls ``and a few days later I saw them and things were working out well for them.''         But not every case works out. One of the first rescue operations the Seattle team went out on involved people trapped under a collapsed building.        ``There was a small tremor and it caused the floor to shift,'' he said. ``The people were killed. They were alive and then they were killed.''         Alvarado said Mexican rescue workers were not happy to see the volunteers. ``You could feel the wall they put up, like they were thinking `What are these guys doing here?' But we just said what do you want us to do? Want us to dig? Move stones?''         ``We said, here are our hands. Use them.         ``When they found out we just wanted to help, they opened up and treated us like kings,'' he said.        Despite the long hours and hard work, Alvarado said he and other members of the team want to go back to see what happened to the medical clinic. They believe it will remain to help the poor.         The Seattle clinic is being supported by donations to the Salvation Army, Mexico Relief Campaign, 233 First Ave. W., P.O. Box C-9219, Seattle, 98109.         ``There was one woman, 82 years old, who hadn't seen a doctor since she was 16 and she came to us,'' Alvarado said. ``I asked her why she came and she said she heard the Seattle clinic had the best doctors in Mexico.         ``Now that makes me feel good.'Caption:  PHOTOJIMI LOTT / SEATTLE TIMES: RUDY ALVARADO, WHO HELPED SET UP A MEDICAL CLINIC IN MEXICO CITY, SAID THE PEOPLE THERE DIDN'T WANT HIM AND OTHER VOLUNTEERS TO LEAVE.
