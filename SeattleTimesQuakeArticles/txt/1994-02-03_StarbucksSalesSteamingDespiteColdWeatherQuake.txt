SEATTLE - Despite an earthquake in southern California and calamitous weather to the east, Starbucks reported strong sales of its coffee products for the four weeks ended Jan. 30.     Recent trends of comparable-store sales into single-digit percentage gains were reversed. Starbucks said those sales, comparing stores open at least 13 months, jumped 12 percent. Total sales rose 70 percent, to $16.5 million from $9.7 million. Sales over 17 weeks showed similar increases.     Starbucks had 287 outlets open as of Jan. 30 and plans to open 91 more before the fiscal year ends next September.
