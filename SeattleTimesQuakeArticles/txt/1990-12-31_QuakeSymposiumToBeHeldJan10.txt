REDMOND        If you thought you'd prepared for enough natural disasters, think again. What about earthquakes?         An earthquake-preparation symposium has been scheduled for 7:30 to 9 p.m. Jan. 10 in the Benjamin Rush Elementary School gymnasium, presented by the Lake Washington School District's Disaster Preparedness Committee.         The group will discuss what kind of earthquakes strike in the Seattle area, how the city of Redmond plans to handle recovery efforts and what the school district has done to prepare.         For further information, call 881-6047.
