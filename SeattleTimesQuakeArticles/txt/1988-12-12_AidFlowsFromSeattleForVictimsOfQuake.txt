Sweaters, parkas, jackets, socks, anything that would help keep people warm was being piled into boxes marked ``Armenian Relief.''        And the pile of boxes grew all yesterday afternoon as more and more people took clothing and food to St. Andrews Episcopal Church near Green Lake.         In a basement meeting room, Seattle's Armenian community was packing the donations for shipment to Soviet Armenia, where an earthquake last Wednesday  has left as many as 60,000 dead and 500,000 people homeless.         It has been a hurried and makeshift effort by the Armenian community of about 300 families.         ``It's winter there and it's very cold,'' said John Pashaian, 64, a machinist at the Todd shipyard. Pashaian emigrated from Soviet Armenia with his wife 24 years ago.          ``They are going to die from cold,'' he said of the many victims trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings.         Pashaian and his wife, Despina, 40, discovered through the large Armenian community in Los Angeles that her relatives were safe. ``We have survivors from Leninakan, Kirovakan and Spitak,'' said Despina Pashaian, naming three cities hard hit by the earthquake. ``They are all now in Yerevan,'' the Armenian capital, she said.         She said her biggest worry now was for a school friend from Leninakan.  She has had no word of the friend.         Meanwhile, Soviet authorities have accepted Alaska's offer to provide specially trained search-and-rescue dogs for work in  Armenia, according to the Associated Press.        The dogs and handlers are members of the Southeast Alaska Dogs Organized for Ground Search, or SEADOGS, a volunteer search-and-rescue group formed in 1976 and based in Juneau.        The Armenian community in Seattle has been overwhelmed by the response to calls for aid, said Minas Tanielian. He and his American wife, Sonia, have been kept nearly sleepless answering phone calls from people who want to know how they can help.         Storage lockers in Issaquah and Lynnwood are full. Today attention will turn to finding a central collection point and warehouse space, said Aida Kouyoumjian of Mercer Island, president of the Armenian Cultural Association of Washington.         The clothing drive was temporarily suspended late last night because the volunteers are overwhelmed and because the Soviets are not yet ready to take donated clothing, she said. But money for medical supplies is an urgent need.         She said the hope is that some of the supplies can be shipped with the Seattle-King County Disaster Relief Team, a private nonprofit organization of health professionals that helped after the Mexico City earthquake of 1985.         Flying Tiger Airlines has donated a 747 that is scheduled to leave Seattle tomorrow with medical supplies and several dozen relief team members, according to Gary Furlong, a Seattle attorney who is helping coordinate the relief effort with the Soviets.         Thirty doctors, nurses and paramedics from Seattle and 16 from Portland will make the trip, Furlong said today. The relief team is the first and possibly only one from the United States granted permission to enter the Soviet Union, said Bob Walsh, president of the Seattle Organizing Committee of the 1990 Goodwill Games. Walsh helped secure permission for the trip, Furlong said.         Furlong said the plane will stop in New York to pick up about 30,000 pounds of supplies and equipment from the Armenian community there and deliver it to the Soviets in Yerevan.         ``The greatest pressing need right now is financial donations to purchase medical equipment and supplies,'' Furlong said, emphasizing that the relief effort will continue for weeks.         Donations of medical supplies have already come in from local Armenians who work in health care. Yesterday at the church one doctor said he would send all his manufacturers' antibiotic samples.         Three portable ultrasound machines that can detect damage to internal organs were shipped from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to Moscow via Helsinki last night aboard a Finnair jetliner. The airline charged a reduced rate to ship the equipment, and the Red Cross picked up the tab.         Advanced Technology Laboratories, a Bothell-based manufacturer of high-tech medical equipment, donated the equipment.         The units, which are worth about $15,000 each, were specifically requested by the Soviets through a group of American physicians helping in the relief effort, according to Hope Tuttle of the Red Cross.         About 60 members of the local Armenian Church worshipped in the chapel at St. Andrews yesterday afternoon, in services that included prayers for the many quake victims.    --  Times East Bureau reporter Steve Clutter contributed to this report.Caption:  PHOTOJIM BATES / SEATTLE TIMES: AMY HAGOPIAN AND HER SON JESSE ATTEND THE MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR THE ARMENIAN EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS AT ST.
