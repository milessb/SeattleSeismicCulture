A major earthquake shook Central America yesterday, unleashing a landslide that buried hundreds of houses near El Salvador's capital and killing at least 81 people across the region. About 1,200 people are believed to be missing in the buried Las Colinas neighborhood just west of San Salvador, and at least 79 people are known to be dead across the country, a National Emergency Committee announced. Police and rescue workers estimated the death toll at near 100. There were fears the number would rise as excavations continued. The 7.6-magnitude quake centered off El Salvador's southern coast also rocked Honduras and Guatemala, where two more deaths were reported. Buildings swayed in Mexico City, about 600 miles to the northwest. Salvadoran President Francisco Flores declared a national emergency and appealed for international aid to help look for buried victims and assist survivors. The downtown areas of the capital that were destroyed in a 1986 earthquake--which killed at least 1,400 people and injured 10,000--escaped relatively unscathed. This time, the worst destruction appeared to be in a middle-class suburb. The quake caused land from a hill of the Balsamo mountain range--deforested by construction activity--to fall on the neighborhood. Hundreds of rescuers frantically ripped at the earth with sticks and bare hands to reach those buried by a 1,500-foot landslide that carried away houses, cars and trees. A distraught Arturo Magana, 25,  wandered about to find his 18-year-old brother, Jaime. "I don't know where to dig, because I don't know where the house is," he said. "This is terrible. I don't think we will be able to pull out any victims. Everything has been buried," said David Lara, a rescue worker struggling with a shovel at the mass of dirt and concrete. Red Cross spokesman Carlos Lopez Medina estimated that 300 houses had been destroyed in Las Colinas. By night, 20 bodies had been recovered. No survivors had yet been found. "There is my boy! Help me! Help me!" wailed Carmen de Marin, 41, weeping beside the buried ruins of her Las Colinas house. She said her 12-year-old son, Jaime Ernesto Marin, had stayed home to await a phone call from his father in the United States when she went out shopping shortly before the quake hit at 11:35 a.m. Some neighbors said that the government bore responsibility for the disaster. "About 400 houses have been buried because of the bulldozers," said Candido Antonio Salinas, 60, referring to the construction. Just days before, Salinas and his neighbors had lost a lawsuit to halt it. "We've tried to stop them, and now, look at the consequences," he said. In the southeastern town of San Miguel, the wall of a hospital collapsed. In a nearby village, 25 people were known to be dead. The quake shattered buildings in several cities in this nation of 6 million. Smaller aftershocks rattled San Salvador, but there was no immediate information on their magnitude. News of the damage was slowed because much of El Salvador's telephone service and electricity was knocked out for several hours. Only sketchy reports had arrived from many hard-hit areas. In Santa Ana, about 35 miles northwest of the capital, the 116-year-old El Calvario church collapsed, killing at least one employee and possibly others worshipping inside, said the Rev. Robert Castro. The Red Cross reported that 13 people died in nearby Sosonati. Some 200 other victims were rushed to the area hospital, which authorities weren't sure was still structurally sound. The quake was centered off the Salvadoran coast, about 65 miles southwest of San Miguel, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver, Colo. It took more than an hour for some San Salvador radio stations to return to the air, and telephone service remained spotty at midafternoon. There were cracked buildings and shattered windows across the city of 500,000. Officials at San Salvador's international airport said all flights had been canceled. Police in neighboring Guatemala said a man and a 2-year-old girl were killed and three other people were injured when a pair of homes collapsed in the city of Jalpataua. Local radio stations reported the collapse of a church in Suchitepequez, in southern Guatemala.       Other quakes A list of major earthquakes in recent decades in Central america.
