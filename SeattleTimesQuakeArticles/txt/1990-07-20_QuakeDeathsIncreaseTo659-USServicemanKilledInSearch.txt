BAGUIO, Philippines - A U.S. Marine plane crashed today while searching for people stranded after a massive earthquake that killed more than 650 people on central Luzon island.        One serviceman was killed and another was injured in the crash near Baguio, a mountain resort 110 miles north of Manila, the U.S. Embassy said.        Officials said at least 224 people - including two Americans - were killed in Baguio during Monday's earthquake, which measured 7.7 on the Richter scale.        Jose de Jesus, chairman of the presidential task force supervising rescue efforts in Baguio, said Marines and Philippine troops had begun operations to rescue more than 100 people believed stranded on highways near Baguio.        The latest casualty figures totaled 659 dead and more than 1,300 injured. About 190 people were believed buried in ruins of seven hotels and in a factory in Baguio that caught fire after the quake, de Jesus said. Rescuers fear most are dead.        One crewman was killed and the other was airlifted to a U.S. military hospital, the U.S. Embassy said. Their names were not released.        Officials said the aircraft was from the U.S.-run Subic Bay naval base 50 miles west of Manila.        British experts prepared to use ultrasonic equipment to check for signs of life in the rubble of the Hyatt Hotel in Baguio.        Nearly 50 people were believed still trapped in the ruins, and officials said hundreds more may have died in remote areas of the stricken region that are only now reporting damage and deaths.        Philippine television, whose crews flew aboard some of the search planes, showed several buses and cars destroyed by landslides. Some residents had used gravel and limestone to write `SOS'' along the highway.        Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said more than 900 others also were feared stranded in a mountain pass along the border of Nueva Vizcaya and Nueva Ecija provinces.
