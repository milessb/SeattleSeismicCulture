When Cupid's love arrows hit their mark during this Valentine's season, expect plenty of wobbly legs.         So it's fitting that you make a big batch of Earthquake Cookies as a treat for your sweet.         Rich with the flavors of chocolate, mocha and cinnamon, these crisp cookies have the crackly appearance of earth veined by a quake or parched by the sun. After the cold weather we've been having, you may opt for the latter interpretation.         The recipe makes 6 dozen, enough to give to friends as Valentine's Day treats or to freeze.         Earthquake Cookies are especially tasty served at a candlelit table with a steaming cup of espresso and a bowl of coffee or chocolate ice cream.         Speaking of chocolate, on your way to the grocery to get the chocolate chips, make a stop at the Overlake Market Chocolate Festival from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. today, 14515 N.E. 20th St., Bellevue. You can taste free samples of more than 20 chocolate products. And speaking of romance, you can get a wild, gamy kiss from the Chocolate Moose at the festival.
