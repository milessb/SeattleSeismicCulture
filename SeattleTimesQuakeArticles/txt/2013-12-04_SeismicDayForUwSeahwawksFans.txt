UNIVERSITY of Washington football fans felt the Earth move on Monday, as the Huskiesâ€™ head football coach Steve Sarkisian announced he would go to the University of Southern California. Across town, Seattle Seahawks fans let out a first-quarter eruption that officially registered as an earthquake. The team went on to summit the NFC with a 34-7 win over New Orleans. The Seahawks also have the best record in the NFL.  The range of emotion from glum to giddy is roughly grounded in the same realm: demonstrated success.  The Seahawks are following a young quarterback to glory, which has evaded the team for nearly a decade.  Sarkisian is returning to familiar turf at USC, where he spent seven seasons learning his coaching skills. He is getting that shot because he proved he could revive a recumbent team and point it toward winning seasons.  Sarkisian leaves the Huskies after five years. In what would be his final season, he led the team to an 8-4 win-loss record, an Apple Cup victory and the possibility of a bowl appearance. Yes, that is why Dawg fans are stunned.  Howling Huskies have to remember Sarkisian took over a team with a 0-12 record. Have the grace to wish him well, and thank him for the turnaround.  He recruited well, gave the team a future and, as the way these things work, caught the eye of a team looking for help. As with the Huskies of old, three or four losses is a disaster for the Trojans.  Lots of talent is prowling the coaching sidelines, eager for a call from the Huskies. And why not? The coach might be leaving, but the talent that stays behind is exceptional.
