Thousands of soldiers raced against the clock today in a search for survivors buried in the ruins of an earthquake that wracked Soviet Armenia and killed as many as 100,000 people, according to reports from the devastated region        ``We still have people screaming from beneath the ruins,'' government spokesman Lev Voznesensky said, ``but every hour those screams become quieter.''         A communique issued by a commission established by the ruling Politburo to deal with the emergency, which also left nearly 500,000 people homeless, stated: ``Every minute counts when it comes to saving the living and retrieving the bodies of the dead.''        As tremors continued to shake the region, rescue teams dug frantically in the rubble of more than a dozen cities and towns, searching for survivors trapped in the thousands of structures that collapsed.        At one factory, soldiers pulled 200 workers alive from beneath fallen walls and a collapsed roof, according to Tass, the official Soviet news agency. But other efforts were less successful as rescuers struggled in vain to lift the heavy stones and concrete beams used in most Armenian buildings.        The newspaper Sotsialisticheskaya Industria reported that rescuers in one town were haunted by the cries for help from a little girl they could not reach in the mangled debris of a building.        In Washington, the Soviet Union issued an unprecedented appeal for American aid - and gratefully accepted the offer of equipment and rescue experts being assembled last night.        ``In the Soviet family of nations, the pain of our Armenian brothers and sisters has become the pain of each and every one of us,'' said Evegeni Kutovi, deputy Soviet ambassador to the United States. ``We in the Soviet Union highly appreciate acts of good will and support demonstrated all over the world.''        Moscow Radio called the relief operation ``unprecedented in Soviet history.'' Tass said 80 jumbo cargo jets were flying round-the-clock to ferry medical equipment, building machinery, workers and materials to the region.        More than 14,000 tons of supplies, including tents, blankets, kitchen utensils, fabrics, medicines and donor blood, was carried to Yerevan, the Armenian capital, by a Soviet Red Cross plane, Tass said.        Tass also said, ``All of the country's railroads have been instructed to allocate freight cars for Transcaucasia-bound cargos. Extra supplies of petrol and diesel fuel have been rushed to Armenia to ensure uninterrupted transportation service.''        Health Ministry official Igor Denisov said 10 transport planes were being used just for medical supplies and added, ``100 Armenian medical teams are in the area, with another 70 teams from other places in the country.''        Medical teams, rescue experts and supplies were being readied from around the world - including Britain, Bulgaria, France, Finland, Switzerland, Italy, Japan, Norway, West Germany, Cuba and the United States.        France alone sent two military transports with 165 medical personnel and specialists in rescue operations. Twenty British mine-rescue specialists, who assisted in digging out people trapped in the Mexican earthquake, were sent by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.         Because of the risk of spreading AIDS, blood donations were not being accepted from abroad; blood donors, who were coming by the hundreds to blood banks in major Soviet cities, were being screened to see whether they were carriers of the virus.        In its first official report on casualties, the Soviet government said ``thousands were killed, tens of thousands injured and hundreds of thousands left homeless'' in ``the strongest quake in Transcaucasia on record.'' The Caucasus Mountains are in the Armenian region.        Soviet officials said it was too early to determine how many people were killed when the quake struck at midmorning Wednesday. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake at 6.9 on the open-ended Richter scale.        Tass said the quake killed ``tens of thousands'' and left 400,000 homeless. But Rudolf Khochanov, an Armenian Foreign Ministry representative in Moscow, said the death toll from the quake ``could be 50,000, 70,000 or even 100,000.''        According to a spokesman for Armenia's official Armenpress news agency, the death toll may be as high as 100,000.        Vladimir Dubinyak, the Interior Ministry chief of staff, said 7,000 troops were in quake-hit areas with the ``sole mission to save people and give them essential aid.''        The temblor, centered near the town of Spitak between Leninakan and Kirovakan - Armenia's second- and third-largest cities - ``struck a territory with a population of over 700,000,'' said a statement by the Communist Party Central Committee and the Presidium of the National Parliament.        The hardest hit were Leninakan, Spitak, Kirovakan and Stepanavan, the statement said.        ``Spitak is wiped out,'' said Khochanov, of the Armenian Foreign Ministry. He seven of eight schools were flattened while the children were attending classes.       Sotsialisticheskaya Industria, the newpaper, said at least 5,000 of Spitak's 16,000 residents were killed.        ``When the headlights of our car showed only a bumpy field, we understood `the worst' was too weak a description - Spitak does not exist any more,'' reported two of the newspaper's correspondents.         Soviet television broadcast aerial films of Spitak, which seemed bereft of life, and of Leninakan, much of which appeared almost to have been bombed into rubble.        International Red Cross officials said Leninakan was 80 percent destroyed and other reports indicated that two-thirds of the town was destroyed.         In Kirovakan, a city of 150,000, half the buildings reportedly were destroyed.        ``People with dead-like faces are sitting along the former streets on bundles,'' said a reporter for the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. ``The streets and alleys are crowded with people who came to help.''         Tass said: ``Yerevan hospitals have already accepted 3,000 people wounded during the quake; hundreds of injured were brought by helicopter and planes to Tbilisi and other cities in Soviet Georgia, a neighboring republic.''        Lev Voznesensky, head of the Soviet Council of Ministers information department, said it was difficult to get accurate information.        ``We simply have not had the experience in modern times of coping with the information,'' he said. ``This disaster is of such proportion, it is extremely difficult for us to provide accurate information.'Caption:  PHOTOUPI / TASS: RESIDENTS OF THE ARMENIAN TOWN OF LENINAKAN LEFT HOMELESS BY A DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE WAIT TO BE EVACUATED.
