MEXICO CITY _ A major earthquake ripped through central Mexico today, devastating portions of the capital, toppling luxury hotels and skyscrapers, starting hundreds of fires and taking a heavy toll of life        Channel 13, the only Mexico City station able to stay on the air, said there were 250 confirmed deaths, but the toll was expected to go much higher as rescuers scrambled to free thousands still buried in the rubble.        The quake, with a magnitude of 7.8 on the Richter scale and centered 40 miles off Mexico's Pacific coast, hit at 7:18 a.m. (5:18 a.m. Seattle time) and crumbled churches, hotels, schools, hospitals and office buildings as far as 250 miles from Mexico City. It was felt all the way to Texas, shaking buildings in Houston.        Hundreds of buildings were damaged in Mexico City, a city of 18 million people, the biggest in the world. The streets were ablaze with natural gas from broken gas pipelines. Hospitals were packed with injured.        Twenty-five people were killed when a church collapsed during Mass in Ciudad Guzman in the state of Jalisco, 420 miles west of Mexico City and some 50 miles inland. Extensive damage was reported in the nearby city of Colima.        ``I heard this trembling and I got out of my bedroom and ran to the hallway,'' a hysterical man who escaped from the Nuevo Leon, a large apartment building in the center of Mexico City, told a TV station.        ``By that time, the walls had caved in on the bedroom and I ran down the stairs. There were people running for their lives. There were rocks flying all over. I got out, but I wasn't able to save my wife.''        Reports from other hard-hit areas were sketchy.        The capital was completely cut off from the outside world and the rest of Mexico as all telephone and telex lines went down.        Schoolchildren waiting for buses stood sobbing for their parents on corners as the city shook, and the usual pall of smog was replaced by a dark cloud of dust from toppling buildings, and smoke from the fires erupting across the city. An elementary school on the downtown Calle Dinamarca in the ``Zona Rosa'' tourist district was destroyed just as children were arriving for classes, but there were no confirmed reports of casualties.        Luxury downtown hotels including the Hotel Versalles and the Hotel di Carlo, both eight stories high, the Hotel Regis and the Hotel Roma collapsed. Major damage was reported at the Ejecutivo, Palace and Reforma hotels. Firemen and rescue workers struggled through tons of brick and concrete to pull bodies from the rubble.        The famed 10-story-high monument to the Mexican Revolution, built in 1910 and a downtown Mexico City landmark, collapsed. Severe damage was reported at several hospitals including the main one operated by the Mexican Social Security Administration.        President Miguel de la Madrid declared a state of emergency for the entire city.        The streets of the capital were in chaos as thousands milled about in shock and ambulances fought the panicked traffic to get the injured to hosptals.        Hysterical radio announcers appealed for calm and begged people to return to their homes, but many were stranded as subway and bus lines ceased operating.        Radio stations broadcast urgent appeals for motorcycle owners to lend them to emergency rescue personnel to help get them through the traffic quicker. Soldiers zoomed through the streets on motorcycles trying to prevent looting.        Three tall buildings in a row, one over 10 stories, near the National Lottery Building collapsed. The old downtown of the capital and the business district along Paseo de la Reforma were the hardest hit.        The National Earthquake Center in Golden, Colo., said the temblor's epicenter was in an earthquake-prone area about 40 miles offshore and 150 miles northwest of Acapulco. The U.S. National Weather Service issued a tsunami watch for Mexico, El Salvador, Ecuador and California but called it off some four hours after the temblor.        Mexico City's Benito Juarez International Airport was closed for hours but later reopened. Jetliners were being at widely spaced intervals from tanker trucks on the runways because underground fuel lines were ruptured.        The capital's Channel 13 showed people hanging onto each other crying in the streets against a backdrop of skyscrapers broken into smoking junk steel and concrete.        Sirens screamed all over the city. Electricity went out in large sections, knocking out traffic lights. The water supply was turned off downtown because of ruptured water mains.        Television announcers appealed to the public to refrain from turning on gas or electricity because of the danger of explosions.        Many downtown streets were impassable because of large chunks of brick that fell off buildings. The pavement was covered with broken glass. Every window in the 20-story Agriculture Ministry was broken.        More than 700 people were killed and more than 300 miles of southeastern Mexico were left a shambles by a quake measured at 6.5 on the Richter scale in September 1973, when at least 24 cities, towns and villages were damaged.
