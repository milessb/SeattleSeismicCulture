LIMA, Peru (UPI) _ An earthquake jolted northern Peru early today, cutting electrical power in two cities and sending panicked Peruvians running into the streets, officials and witnesses said.        The quake registered between 4.5 and 5.0 on the Richter scale, a Civil Defense spokesman said. The U.S. Geological Survey in Washington said it registered 6.1.        Its epicenter was 48 miles southwest of the northern coastal city of Trujillo, about 280 miles north of Lima.        The most affected city appeared to be Chimbote, 240 miles north of Lima, where radio reports said at least 15 people were treated at hospitals for fainting spells and blows to the head. Some walls were toppled or cracked, and electricity and telephones were knocked out temporarily.        Power also was out for an hour in Cajamarca, 420 miles north of Lima, radio reports said.
