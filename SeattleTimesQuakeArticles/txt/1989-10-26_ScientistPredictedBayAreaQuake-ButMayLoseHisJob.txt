SAN JOSE, Calif. - A scientist with an unusual method of forecasting earthquakes predicted last week's deadly quake, but he may lose his job for ``creating fear in the public'' by predicting more.         Jim Berkland, a geologist for Santa Clara County, was on indefinite administrative leave on orders from irate County Executive Sally Reed.         Berkland, 59, who calculates the number of runaway dogs and cats and the gravitational pull of the sun and the moon to forecast earthquakes, predicted in a story printed Oct. 13 in the Gilroy Dispatch that there would be a large earthquake between Oct. 14 and 21 with a magnitude of between 3.5 and 6.0 on the Richter scale.         ``But when record numbers of dogs and cats began running away,'' Berkland said, ``I called the newspaper and said there was an 85 percent probability that there would be a 6.5 or larger quake during the World Series.''         The Oct. 17 earthquake in the Bay Area measured 7.1 on the Richter scale.         But the geologist's employment troubles did not begin until at least two other newspaper stories said he also predicted earthquakes measuring 7.0 will occur in November and in December.         Reed accused Berkland of ``creating fear in the public'' with his predictions. She ordered him Tuesday to take a paid administrative leave, saying Berkland has been unable to separate his ``hobby'' from his day-to-day work as county geologist.         Berkland accepted the decision but was unrepentant. The newspapers quoted him incorrectly, he said, noting that he actually predicted quakes ranging from 3.5 to 5.5 on the Richter scale for Nov. 10-17 and Dec. 11-18.         ``The quakes will be within 70 miles of San Jose and will not have aftershocks,'' he said.         ``The last thing I want to do is create public panic, and I'll do everything I can to allay that fear,'' Berkland said. ``But as a scientist, I have to pursue my scientific findings.''         Stephen Kirby, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist in Menlo Park, Calif., who has been studying earthquakes for 21 years, said Berkland's techniques of predicting earthquakes have been shown to be no more reliable than random guessing.
