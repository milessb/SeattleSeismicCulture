MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Crews trying to reach a 9-year-old boy trapped in rubble from the Sept. 19 earthquake stopped working last night but resumed at a slower pace early today after protests from the boy's father, who believes his son still is alive        Rescuers working with shovels and earth-moving equipment left the wreckage of the apartment building last night, saying they needed rest. But they resumed work after hours of discussions with the boy's father.        The family holds out hope that the boy, Luis Ramon Nafarrate, is alive, although a scan of debris with highly sensitive sound equipment Saturday night found no signs of life.        The last survivors of the quake were rescued more than a week ago, but hope surged last Wednesday when rescuers said they had detected sounds inside the ruined apartment building.
