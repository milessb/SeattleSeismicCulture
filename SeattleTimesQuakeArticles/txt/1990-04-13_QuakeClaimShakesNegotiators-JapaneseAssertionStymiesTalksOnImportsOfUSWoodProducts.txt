TOKYO - Long-suffering U.S. trade negotiators, having already come to grips with assertions that Japanese intestines are shorter than Americans' and Japanese snow finer-grained, have just been shaken to learn that - the San Francisco Bay Area's experience aside - Japanese earthquakes are tougher than the American variety        This rationale was offered during current talks on increasing imports of U.S. lumber products in partial explanation of why Japan cannot alter its building codes to allow for more wood construction.        U.S. industry representatives said the  claim illustrated what they were up against in the latest round of talks,  which ended today without an agreement.         ``We have concluded our talks at this round after agreeing to hold another round of talks in the near future,'' said a Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity.        ``Japanese quakes are no different than American quakes,'' said an exasperated Barry  Cullen, president of the National Forest Products Association. ``These talks have been very disappointing to us. We want to see substantial progress, not stonewalling.''        President Bush took a somewhat brighter view of the trade situation, saying yesterday that the United States and Japan must resolve more disputes to ease trade tensions but that ``great progress    has been made'' with an agreement reached last week on satellites, supercomputers and telecommunications.        Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu met in Palm Springs, Calif., in March to discuss trade tensions arising from the $49 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.        Bush said Kaifu ``has exemplified the best in cooperation and leadership. He's taken some very strong positions there.''        The president congratulated Trade Representative Carla Hills, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady for the success of U.S.-Japanese negotiations that resulted in the trade accord.        Bush told the officials, however, ``Lest any of you feel like you can totally relax, there are some outstanding issues,''  - specifically  forest products.        In past rounds of negotiations on other areas of bilateral trade, Japanese officials argued that the people of Japan couldn't possibly digest more American beef because their intestines were too short and American skis couldn't possibly be used on Japanese slopes because the snow had a finer texture.        In time, these protestations caved in and the markets for beef and skis opened - sort of. Now it's timber's turn, and the Japanese side appears to have lapsed back into inflexibility.        If the two sides don't reach agreement by June 16,  Hills may take retaliatory action, since the    lumber trade is one of three priority issues targeted in the Super 301 clause of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act.        The latest official manifestation of what makes Japan different stumped representatives of the U.S. timber industry, who are in Tokyo during the seventh round of wood-products talks this year.        ``Earthquakes act the same everywhere in the world,'' said Forest Association safety expert Ronald  Walker. ``The only difference is severity. Japanese government experts say they're much more severe here than in other parts of the world, but the worst have been in Yugoslavia and other countries like that.''        Spokesmen for the Japanese ministries of Forestry and Construction, which are participating in the lumber talks, refused to comment. However, an earthquake specialist with the National Meteorological Agency said it wasn't the earthquakes themselves that were different but the sort of earth it was that quaked.        The U.S. lumber industry's argument for why Japan should import more wood is based heavily on tests that show wood construction bears up to quakes and fires at least as well as, if not better than, steel and masonry.        Cullen told a news conference that the real barriers to increased timber use in the Japanese construction industry are ``antiquated codes and building standards,'' particularly those related to earthquakes and fires.        He also speculated that the Japanese government is trying to protect the country's ``less efficient'' manufacturers of finished lumber products. ``The U.S. timber industry is the most efficient in the world,'' he said.        Last year, Japan bought $2.7 billion worth of U.S. timber exports, nearly half the $6 billion worth of products the industry shipped abroad. But more than 70 percent of the Japanese purchases were of non-processed wood materials, such as logs and chips, while just under 30 percent were of finished materials, such as plywood sheets and paneling.        The industry is striving to boost the percentage of finished goods because they account for extra profit. Cullen said the package of U.S. proposals under negotiation in the current talks would, if adopted, raise current sales by $2 billion as well as create between 17,000 and 20,000 new jobs for Americans.        By easing ``unnecessary restrictions'' in building codes and allowing the use of U.S. materials and construction techniques, Cullen said, the Japanese would halve the cost of building a wooden house.Caption:  PHOTOTOSHIKI KAIFU
