MEXICO CITY _ More buildings crumbled yesterday in the heart of Mexico City after a second earthquake struck Friday night.        No new casualties were reported. But U.S. Ambassador to Mexico John Gavin, saying damage to the city was ``much greater than we have been led to believe,'' estimated the death toll to be at least 10,000 and possibly double that.        Mexican authorities put the toll officially at 3,000. The respected newspaper El Universal said it was 4,000.        The fact is, nobody knew for sure.        Five U.S. citizens are known to have died in the quake _ a married couple and a woman and her two children. Officials suspect that several more lie beneath the rubble of tourist hotels that collapsed in the tremors.        Gavin made his assessment yesterday after a tour of the city by air. ``There are places where it looks like a giant foot might have stepped on the buildings,'' he told reporters. He said the city, from the air, was a ``remarkable and terrifying sight.''        A government spokesman said that of 50 buildings seriously damaged by the first quake on Thursday morning, more than 20 toppled Friday night. The first temblor measured 7.8 on the Richter scale; the second 7.3. Anything higher than 7 on the ground-motion scale is labeled ``major.''        But fear was more widespread than structural damage after Friday night's quake.        As it struck, people screamed and sought refuge in open spaces. Thousands camped overnight in sprawling Chapultepec Park or slept in their cars for fears of new cave-ins.         Many families spent the night on traffic islands in the middle of streets. Others stayed in the Zocalo, the gigantic square outside the National Palace in the heart of the ancient city.        As the new temblor was felt, an army of 50,000 rescuers froze in their tracks. Traffic lights swayed violently, roads heaved and more buildings crumbled.        Damage in the renowned resort of Acapulco, near the epicenter of the tremors under the Pacific seabed, was reported to be light.        Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid said his debt-burdened country lacked the resources to recover quickly.        ``The tragedy was of such a magnitude that it has set us back in many ways,'' he said yesterday. ``We will not be able to do what we wanted to do. The truth is that we do not have enough resources to confront the disaster quickly or adequately.''        The earthquakes also brought fresh financial worries for Mexico, whose nearly $100 billion foreign debt is the largest in the developing world after Brazil's.        A monetary source in Washington said Mexico could be eligible for an International Monetary Fund loan of between $300 million and $600 million from fund money intended for disaster relief.        But the source said no request for such assistance had been made nor was it being considered. He added that such a disaster relief loan would be unrelated to the IMF's talks with Mexico on restoring the health of the economy.        The IMF said yesterday that loans to Mexico had been suspended because of non-compliance with the agency's economic reform program.        De la Madrid, in a television address Friday night that was rebroadcast several times yesterday, said, ``We are gradually re-establishing normalcy.''        Appealing for national unity, de la Madrid said: ``We will bury our dead with sadness, but at the same time we will renew our will to live and to cure our wounds.''        One of the city's hardest-hit areas was the Colonia Roma, a middle-class district fairly close to downtown. De la Madrid had lived there most of his childhood and as a young man.        As de la Madrid spoke, the Defense Ministry announced it was rushing another 3,000 troops to assist in the relief effort in the capital _ the world's most populous city with 18 million inhabitants.         And the tales of calamity continued.         In the densely populated working-class district of Tlaltelolco, whose foundations lie atop the ruins of ancient Aztec temples, the 13-story Nuevo Leon apartment building once towered over an area as large as a city block.        But it took less than a minute to collapse Thursday morning. By some accounts, no one who was in the building at the time survived. That means hundreds of people _ possibly 1,000 _ died.        Maria Elena Buendia, her husband and her 15-year-old daughter were not home when the quake struck. But her three sons, ages 19, 20 and 22, were.        As the slow task of locating the victims continued, Buendia kept a curbside vigil across the street. But as her watch entered the second day, hope ebbed and anger and frustration grew.        She looked at the scores of soldiers lining the street.        ``They don't help,'' she complained of the soldiers, weeping as she spoke. ``They just obstruct.''        Of the five U.S. citizens known to have died in the quake, three were identified by the State Department as Mary Vallejo, 34, of Nebraska, and her children, Ilse, 8, and Alonzo, 5. Another was reported to be a native of San Antonio, Texas.      In Washington, President Reagan yesterday announced that his wife, Nancy, would visit Mexico tomorrow to lend support to the relief effort.        ``We greatly admire the bravery and resolve of the Mexican people to dedicate all their resources to overcome this calamitous event,'' Reagan said.Caption:  PHOTOPAUL RICHARDS / UPI: RESCUE WORKERS USE A CRANE TO SEARCH THE RUINS OF MEXICO CITY'S NATIONAL COLLEGE OF PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION.UPI: WORKERS GO THROUGH THE RUBBLE OF A DOWNTOWN MEXICO CITY BUILDING DESTROYED BY THE EARTHQUAKE
