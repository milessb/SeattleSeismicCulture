MILWAUKEE â€” A minor earthquake occurred this week near the eastern Wisconsin town where researchers have been investigating a series of unexplained booming sounds, federal geologists said Thursday. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said the 1.5-magnitude earthquake struck Tuesday just after midnight in Clintonville, a town of about 4,600 people about 40 miles west of Green Bay. Geophysicist Paul Caruso said loud booms have been known to accompany earthquakes. It's possible the sounds town officials have been investigating are linked to the quake, he said. Earthquakes can generate seismic energy that moves through rock at thousands of miles per hour, producing a sonic boom when the waves come to the earth's surface, Caruso said. "To be honest, I'm skeptical that there'd be a sound report associated with such a small earthquake, but it's possible," he said. Those reservations didn't stop Clintonville City Administrator Lisa Kuss from declaring "the mystery is solved" at a news conference late Thursday. She said USGS representatives described the event as a swarm of several small earthquakes in a very short time. "In other places in the United States, a 1.5 earthquake would not be felt," she said. "But the type of rock Wisconsin has transmits seismic energy very well." Caruso said the Tuesday earthquake was discovered after people reported feeling something, and geologists pored through their data to determine that an earthquake did indeed strike. Local residents have reported late-night disturbances since Sunday, including a shaking ground and loud booms that sound like thunder or fireworks. City officials investigated and ruled out a number of human-related explanations, such as construction, traffic, military exercises and underground work.
