PALMER, Alaska - A moderate earthquake with a magnitude of 5.1 on the Richter scale was recorded Wednesday night near the tip of the Aleutian Islands, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center reported.        No  injuries or damage was reported but the quake was felt by personnel at the Adak Naval Station in the Andreanof Islands, Tsunami center spokesman Wayne Jorgensen said.        The quake was centered about 50 miles southeast of Adak, near the tip of the Aleutian Islands and about 1,100 miles southwest of Anchorage at 8:14 p.m. AST,  Jorgensen said.        He said there was no danger of a tsunami, or tidal wave.        A 5.6 quake centered in the central Aleutian Islands was recorded Tuesday. No damage or injuries were reported from that quake either.        A U.S. Geological Survey seismologist at the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said Wednesday night that scientists were trying to determine if Wednesday's quake was an aftershock of Tuesday's tremor.        The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.        An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in a local area, 4 can cause moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, and 6 can be severe. A 7 reading is a ``major'' quake, capable of widespread heavy damage, and 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.        The 1964 Alaska quake that killed 131 people measured 8.4 on the Richter scale, while the San Francisco quake of 1906 was estimated to register 8.3.
