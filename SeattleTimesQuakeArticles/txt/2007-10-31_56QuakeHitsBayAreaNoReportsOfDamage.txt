SAN JOSE, Calif. â€” A magnitude-5.6 earthquake shook the San Francisco Bay Area Tuesday night, rattling homes and nerves, but there were no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries. The moderate temblor struck shortly after 8 p.m., about 9 miles northeast of San Jose, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The California Highway Patrol received no reports of damage or injuries, spokesman Tom Marshall said. It was the strongest tremor in the Bay Area since 1989, when a magnitude-7.1 quake killed 62 people. The epicenter of the quake was near Alum Rock, in the Diablo Range foothills east of San Jose.
