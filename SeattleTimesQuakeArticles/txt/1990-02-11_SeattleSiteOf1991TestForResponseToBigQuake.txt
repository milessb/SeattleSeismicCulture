The worst time for Seattle's big earthquake - considered by scientists to be almost inevitable - would be on a workday, during rush hour in cold, rainy weather, striking without warning.         That's one reason a major earthquake-response test by federal, state and local governments has been scheduled in Seattle for November 1991.         Although the exercise will be largely invisible to the public, it will test a national plan to rush aid to areas where a catastrophic earthquake has killed thousands of people, knocked out communications, paralyzed police and fire departments and virtually eliminated the ability of hospitals and doctors to treat the injured.         The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) last week reported progress of the national plan to heads of federal agencies in the Seattle area.         The Puget Sound area is considered one of the more vulnerable areas in the United States for a major quake.          The first first emergency-response exercise was in California's Bay Area last year, just months before the Loma Prieta earthquake on Oct. 17. The second, which would have been in Seattle except for complications of the Goodwill Games, will be in Salt Lake City this year.         Twenty-five federal agencies, including the Departments of Agriculture, which would procure and transport food into stricken areas, have agreed to participate in the national plan.         What is a catastrophic earthquake?          Bob Freitag, FEMA's chief regional earthquake planner, said that, regardless of the quake's magnitude on the Richter scale, it would be one where local government services collapse and where there are large numbers of casualties.         The national earthquake plan departs from usual federal disaster assistance, which is provided during the recovery phase. This plan is designed to coordinate federal agencies in providing immediate, massive assistance after an earthquake the president declares a major disaster.         Ray Williams, acting regional director for FEMA, said the biggest immediate problem would be lack of information along with ``the inability to use the information gathering and distributing system.''          The plan calls for government agencies to send representatives to the FEMA headquarters in Bothell, which is equipped with radio-communication equipment. If that control center is knocked out, FEMA's center in San Francisco would act as backup, he said.         ``We don't have the communication problem licked yet,'' he said. ``A major earthquake is second only to nuclear war in the devastation that could be caused.'
