ANCHORAGE _ A moderate earthquake rattled south-central Alaska yesterday, causing no reported damage but recalling for some a devastating quake that hit on Good Friday 23 years ago.        Yesterday's quake, measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale, occurred at 7:02 p.m. Seattle time and was centered about 30 miles northwest of Anchorage.        A smaller quake followed 12 minutes later with a magnitude of 4.5.        The Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer received no reports of damage, but the quake was widely felt in south-central Alaska. In downtown Anchorage, workers scurried out of buildings as floors and furniture swayed slightly.        The 1964 Good Friday earthquake, which measured 8.5 on the Richter scale, destroyed much of downtown Anchorage. Centered in Prince William Sound, it generated large waves that devastated several Alaska coastal communities and killed 114 people as far south as Oregon and Hawaii.
