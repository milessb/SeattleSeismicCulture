A program designed to teach homeowners about earthquake risk is offering several free classes through December. The Earthquake-Safe Home program, sponsored by local emergency management offices, State Farm Insurance and Simpson Strong-Tie, is focused on teaching homeowners about earthquake safety and how to secure a home and possessions. The two-hour classes will include information on retrofitting to help limit damage during an earthquake, the permitting process for a retrofit and safety issues involved. The Web site also offers information on how to secure your home and its contents, some geology and history information on the region and links to more information. To see the schedule of classes, visit www.3days3ways.org, click on the "Earthquake-Safe Home" campaign, then "Take a class," or call 877-226-5848. The Web site also offers guidance on creating a family plan for a disaster; building a disaster kit with basics such as food, water, radio, blankets and medication; and ways to help others, including First Aid training.
