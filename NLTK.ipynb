    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is often taught at the academic level from the perspective of computational linguists. However, as data scientists, we have a richer view of the natural language world - unstructured data that by its very nature has latent information that is important to humans. NLP practioners have benefited from machine learning techniques to unlock meaning from large corpora, and in this class we’ll explore how to do that particularly with Python and with the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). \n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK is an excellent library for machine-learning based NLP, written in Python by experts from both academia and industry. Python allows you to create rich data applications rapidly, iterating on hypotheses. The combination of Python + NLTK means that you can easily add language-aware data products to your larger analytical workflows and applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Overview of NLTK\n",
    "NLTK stands for the Natural Language Toolkit and is written by two eminent computational linguists, Steven Bird (Senior Research Associate of the LDC and professor at the University of Melbourne) and Ewan Klein (Professor of Linguistics at Edinburgh University). NTLK provides a combination of natural language corpora, lexical resources, and example grammars with language processing algorithms, methodologies and demonstrations for a very pythonic \"batteries included\" view of Natural Language Processing.   \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, NLTK is perfect for researh driven (hypothesis driven) workflows for agile data science. Its suite of libraries includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- tokenization, stemming, and tagging\n",
    "- chunking and parsing\n",
    "- language modeling\n",
    "- classification and clustering\n",
    "- logical semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK is a useful pedagogical resource for learning NLP with Python and serves as a starting place for producing production grade code that requires natural language analysis. It is also important to understand what NLTK is _not_:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Production ready out of the box\n",
    "- Lightweight\n",
    "- Generally applicable\n",
    "- Magic\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK provides a variety of tools that can be used to explore the linguistic domain but is not a lightweight dependency that can be easily included in other workflows, especially those that require unit and integration testing or other build processes. This stems from the fact that NLTK includes a lot of added code but also a rich and complete library of corpora that power the built-in algorithms. \n",

    "- Lots of extra stuff (heavyweight dependency)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - papers, chat programs, alignments, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the good and the bad parts will help you explore NLTK further - looking into the source code to extract the material you need, then moving that code to production. We will explore NLTK in more detail in the rest of this notebook. \n",

    "## Installing NLTK\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has a few dependencies, most of which can be installed via the python package manger - `pip`. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python 2.7 or later (anaconda is ok)\n",
    "2. NLTK\n",
    "3. The NLTK corpora \n",
    "4. The BeautifulSoup library\n",
    "5. The gensim libary\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have Python and pip installed you can install NLTK as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~$ pip install nltk\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ~$ pip install matplotlib\n",

    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary responsibility you will have before any task involving NLP is to ingest and transform raw text into a corpus that can then be used for performing further evaluations. NLTK provides many corpora for you to work with for exploration, but you must become able to design and construct your own corpora, and to implement `nltk.CorpusReader` objects - classes that in a memory safe and efficient way are able to read entire corpora and analyze them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many people get away with the `nltk.PlainTextCorpusReader` - which uses built-in taggers and tokenizers to deal with raw text. However, this methodology leaves you at the mercy of the tagging model that you have provided, and does not allow you to make corrections that are saved in between runs. Instead you should preprocess your text to allow it to be read by the `nltk.corpus.TaggedCorpusReader` or the penultimate corpus, the `nltk.corpus.BracketParseCorpusReader`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will transform raw text into a format that can then be read by the `nltk.corpus.TaggedCorpusReader`. See the documentation at [http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.corpus.reader.html](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.corpus.reader.html) for more information on this reader. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will find 20-40 documents of recent tech articles from Engadget and Tech Crunch at the following link: [http://bit.ly/nlpnltkcorpus](http://bit.ly/nlpnltkcorpus) - please download them to your local file system. Write a Python program that uses NLTK to preprocess these documents into a format that can be easily read by the `nltk.corpus.TaggedCorpusReader`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you will have to process these files and remove HTML tags and you might have to do other tasks related to the clean up; to do this I suggest you use the third party library BeautifulSoup which can be found at [http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/). See also Chapter 3 in the NLTK book for more information.\n",

    "#### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the word count and vocabulary of this corpus?\n",
    "2. What is the lexical diversity of the corpus?\n",
    "3. What are the 5 most common lexical categories (parts of speech)?\n",
    "4. What are the 10 most common unigrams, the 10 most common bigrams? (please exclude stopwords, using the `nltk.corpus.stopwords('english')` list)\n",
    "5. How many nouns are in the corpus?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a seed inventory of pre-terminal and non-terminal symbols (grammatical categories) and a sample lexicon, write a grammar for English noun phrases. Your grammar should cover all legal structures of noun phrases used by the grammatical categories provided. You must include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- noun-noun compounds (\"brick wall\", \"lawn chair\")\n",
    "- relative clauses of the form Rel-Cl ⟶ Rel-Pro V NP (\"[the ball] that hit her\") \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You do not need to cover more than one PP in a row, more than one adjective in a row, noun-noun compounds of length > 2, quantifiers followed by determiners (\"all of these\") or mass nouns (\"beer\", \"sincerity\")\n",
    "\n",
    "You should then write a program that uses an NLTK parser and the grammar you constructed that will return a syntactic tree if the input is a noun phrase or None if the input is ungrammatical. Your program will have to take the input sentence, tokenize it and then tag it according to the lexicon (you can assume that words in this lexicon do not have multiple senses) - you'll then have to pass the grammar phrase (the tags) to the parser.\n",

    "In the first week you created an ingestion mechanism and an NLTK corpus reader for a set of RSS feeds. These feeds potentially have topics associated with them (broad tags like tech, news, sports, etc). In this question you'll build a classifier on a data set of RSS feeds that is provided in the course materials to decide whether or not you can categorize the various topics using one of the classifiers you learned in this week.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corpus is constructed as follows. Each individual blog post is in its own HTML file stored in a directory labled with the topic. Use the `nltk.CategorizedCorpusReader` or the `nltk.CategorizedPlaintextCorpusReader` to construct your corpora (you may review how the movie reviews data set is structured). To do this you need to pass to the corpus the path to the root of your corpus, and a regular expression to match file names. You also need to use a regular expression passed as the `cat_pattern` keyword argument, which is used to match the category labels. Here is an example for the spam corpus:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from nltk.corpus import CategorizedPlaintextCorpusReader as EmailCorpus\n",

    "\n",
    "Create a function that extracts features per document. Choose any features you would like. One idea is to use the most common unigrams; you might be able to use common bigrams as well. If you can think of any other features, feel free to include them as well (maybe an includes_recipe feature, etc.)) You may want to consider a TF-IDF feature to improve your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train the classifier of your choice on the training data, and then improve it with your dev set. Report your final accuracy and the most informative features by running the accuracy checker on the final test set.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Report accuracy and most informative features of classifier (4 points)\n",

    "The second question involves comparing and contrast the Naive Bayes Classifier with the Maximum Entropy classifier. You will be given an abbreviated data set of product names and their descriptions as well as their label (tops, bottoms, shoes, etc.) - similarly to question one, create a corpus that can read the CSV file - you may want to look at the `nltk.corpus.WordListCorpusReader` for inspiration about how to create such a corpus (each product is on a single line).\n",

    "Create test and training sets from the data then build both a NaiveBayes and Maxent classifier - make sure that you save these classifiers to disk using the `pickle` module!
